Here are some key historical facts about how nuclear energy became used to create electricity:</p> <p>Discovery of Nuclear Fission (1938): The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and later explained theoretically by physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, laid the groundwork for the development of nuclear power. Nuclear fission is the process in which the nucleus of an atom is split into smaller fragments, releasing large amounts of energy.</p> <p>Manhattan Project (1942-1946): During World War II, the Manhattan Project was initiated by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada to develop nuclear weapons. This project led to the successful development of the first atomic bombs, which were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, effectively ending the war.</p> <p>Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) (1951): EBR-I, located in Idaho, USA, became the world's first electricity-generating nuclear power plant on December 20, 1951. It produced enough electricity to power four light bulbs and later generated enough power to illuminate the entire facility.</p> <p>Calder Hall (1956): Calder Hall in the United Kingdom became the world's first commercial nuclear power station to deliver electricity to a public grid in 1956. It was based on a gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor design and marked a significant milestone in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p> <p>Shippingport Atomic Power Station (1957): Located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Shippingport Atomic Power Station was the first full-scale atomic electric power plant devoted exclusively to peacetime uses. It began operation in 1957 and was the first commercial central electric generating station in the United States to use nuclear energy to produce electricity on a large scale.</p> <p>Three Mile Island Accident (1979): The partial meltdown of a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, USA, in 1979 was a significant event in the history of nuclear power. While it didn't result in any immediate deaths or injuries, it had a profound impact on public perception and regulation of nuclear power in the United States.</p> <p>Chernobyl Disaster (1986): The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, remains one of the worst nuclear accidents in history. It occurred due to a flawed reactor design and operator errors during a safety test. The disaster led to widespread radioactive contamination and significant health and environmental consequences.</p> <p>Fukushima Daiichi Disaster (2011): The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan was triggered by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, leading to meltdowns, hydrogen explosions, and the release of radioactive materials. It was the most severe nuclear accident since Chernobyl and resulted in widespread evacuations, long-term displacement of residents, and significant environmental and health concerns.</p> <p>Despite these major accidents, nuclear power continues to be used for electricity generation in many countries around the world, with ongoing efforts to improve safety measures, develop advanced reactor designs, and address concerns about nuclear waste disposal and proliferation.</p>"},{"location":"energy_source/nuclear/#how-it-works","title":"How it works","text":"<p>Nuclear power plants generate electricity through a process called nuclear fission. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Nuclear Fission: Nuclear fission is the process where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller fragments, releasing a large amount of energy. This process is typically initiated by bombarding certain types of heavy atoms, such as uranium-235 (^235U) or plutonium-239 (^239Pu), with neutrons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fuel Rods: The nuclear fuel used in most nuclear reactors is uranium-235. The uranium is enriched to increase the concentration of uranium-235 isotopes. The enriched uranium is formed into ceramic pellets, which are then stacked into metal tubes called fuel rods. These fuel rods are assembled into bundles, known as fuel assemblies, which are placed within the reactor core.</p> </li> <li> <p>Control Rods: Control rods made of materials such as boron or cadmium are inserted into the reactor core alongside the fuel assemblies. These control rods absorb neutrons and help regulate the rate of the nuclear reaction by controlling the number of neutrons available to induce fission.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heat Generation: When a neutron strikes the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom, it can cause the nucleus to split, releasing more neutrons and a large amount of heat energy. This heat energy is used to convert water into steam.</p> </li> <li> <p>Steam Generation: The heat generated from nuclear fission is transferred to a coolant, typically water, circulating through the reactor core. The hot coolant water passes through a heat exchanger, where it heats a separate loop of water to produce steam. This steam is under high pressure and is used to drive turbines connected to generators.</p> </li> <li> <p>Turbine and Generator: The high-pressure steam from the heat exchanger is directed onto turbine blades, causing the turbine to spin. The spinning turbine is connected to a generator, which converts mechanical energy from the turbine into electrical energy. This electrical energy is then fed into the electrical grid for distribution to consumers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cooling Systems: After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed back into water in a separate part of the power plant called the condenser. The condensed water is then pumped back to the heat exchanger to be reheated and turned into steam again. Cooling systems, such as cooling towers or bodies of water, are used to dissipate excess heat from the condenser.</p> </li> <li> <p>Safety Systems: Nuclear power plants are equipped with multiple safety systems to ensure safe operation and mitigate the risk of accidents. These include redundant control systems, emergency shutdown mechanisms, containment structures, and backup power supplies to maintain cooling and safety systems in the event of power loss.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, nuclear power plants harness the energy released from nuclear fission to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity through steam turbines and generators.

The photovoltaic effect describes the phenomenon where certain materials, when exposed to light, generate an electric current. This occurs due to the interaction between photons (light particles) and electrons within the material.</p> <p>Solar Cells:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells, are the basic building blocks of solar panels.

Other materials such as thin-film semiconductors (e.g., cadmium telluride, amorphous silicon) are also used in some solar cell technologies.</p> </li> <li> <p>When sunlight (which is composed of photons) strikes the solar cell, photons with sufficient energy can dislodge electrons from the semiconductor material, creating electron-hole pairs.</p> </li> <li> <p>The semiconductor material is purposely doped to create a p-n junction, which creates an electric field within the cell. This electric field causes the liberated electrons to move towards the n-type (negative) side of the cell and the holes (positively charged vacancies left by the dislodged electrons) to move towards the p-type (positive) side.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Generation of Direct Current (DC): As the electrons move from the p-type region to the n-type region, they create a flow of electric current. This flow of electrons constitutes a direct current (DC). However, this current alone cannot power most household or industrial appliances, which typically operate on alternating current (AC).</p> <p>Inverter: To make the electricity generated by solar panels usable for most applications, it needs to be converted from DC to AC. This is achieved using an inverter, a device that converts the DC electricity produced by the solar panels into AC electricity that can be used to power appliances and fed into the electrical grid.</p> <p>Power Distribution: The AC electricity produced by the inverter can be used directly to power appliances in a home or business. Any excess electricity generated can be fed into the electrical grid, often through a process called net metering. In net metering systems, the surplus electricity is credited to the consumer's utility bill, effectively spinning their meter backward.</p> <p>Utility Grid Connection: In grid-connected solar power systems, solar panels are typically connected to the utility grid. This allows users to draw electricity from the grid when their demand exceeds the solar generation (e.g., at night or on cloudy days) and to export excess electricity back to the grid when their solar panels produce more electricity than they consume.</p> <p>Battery Storage (Optional): In off-grid or hybrid solar power systems, where connection to the utility grid is not available or desired, electricity generated by solar panels can be stored in batteries for later use when sunlight is not available.

The blades are aerodynamically designed to capture the kinetic energy of the wind. They are shaped like airplane wings, with a curved profile that creates lift as the wind flows over them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rotor: The blades are attached to a hub, forming the rotor. The rotor is mounted on top of a tall tower, where it can access stronger and more consistent winds. The rotor rotates as the wind blows, converting the wind's kinetic energy into rotational mechanical energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generator: Inside the nacelle, which is the housing atop the tower, is the generator. The rotational motion of the rotor spins a shaft connected to the generator. The generator converts the mechanical energy from the rotating shaft into electrical energy through the principles of electromagnetic induction. Most modern wind turbines use synchronous generators or asynchronous (induction) generators to produce electricity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Yaw System: Wind direction is constantly changing, so wind turbines are equipped with a yaw system that allows them to turn and face into the wind. The yaw system consists of sensors that detect wind direction and motors that control the orientation of the nacelle and rotor to maximize energy capture.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pitch System: The pitch system allows for the adjustment of the blade angle to optimize power production and control the turbine's speed. When wind speeds are too high or too low, the pitch system can adjust the angle of the blades to maintain optimal performance and protect the turbine from damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Anemometer and Wind Vane: An anemometer measures the speed of the wind, while a wind vane determines its direction. These sensors provide crucial data for the turbine's control system to adjust its orientation and blade pitch for optimal performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Control System: The control system of a wind turbine manages its operation, monitoring various parameters such as wind speed, wind direction, turbine speed, power output, and grid conditions. Based on this data, the control system adjusts the yaw, pitch, and other parameters to maximize energy production while ensuring safe and reliable operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transformer and Grid Connection: The electricity generated by the turbine's generator is typically in the form of alternating current (AC). A transformer inside the nacelle steps up the voltage to facilitate efficient transmission of electricity over long distances. The electricity is then fed into power lines and transmitted to the electrical grid for distribution to consumers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By harnessing the power of the wind, modern wind turbines can generate clean and renewable electricity to help meet the world's energy needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>"},{"location":"hardware/battery/","title":"Battery","text":""},{"location":"hardware/battery/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>The history of batteries dates back thousands of years, with significant developments occurring over time.</p> <p>Baghdad Battery (250 BCE - 640 CE): The Baghdad Battery, also known as the Parthian Battery, is an ancient artifact dating back to around 250 BCE to 640 CE.

Here's an overview of its evolution:</p> <p>Early Lighting Methods: Before the invention of the electric bulb, various methods were used for lighting, including candles, oil lamps, and gas lamps. These sources of light were relatively inefficient, produced dim light, and posed fire hazards.</p> <p>Early Electric Lighting Experiments: In the early 19th century, scientists began experimenting with electric lighting. In 1802, Sir Humphry Davy demonstrated the electric arc lamp, which produced light by creating an arc of electricity between two carbon rods. While effective, arc lamps were impractical for everyday use due to their high energy consumption and tendency to flicker.</p> <p>Incandescent Lamp Inventions: The breakthrough in electric lighting came with the invention of the incandescent lamp. In 1809, English chemist Sir Humphry Davy created the first known incandescent light by passing electricity through a thin strip of platinum. However, platinum was too expensive for practical use.</p> <p>Joseph Swan's Incandescent Lamp: In the 1870s, British inventor Joseph Swan developed a practical incandescent lamp using a carbonized paper filament housed in a vacuum bulb. Swan's design marked a significant advancement in lighting technology, but his early bulbs had a short lifespan.</p> <p>Thomas Edison's Contribution: Concurrently, in the United States, Thomas Edison was also working on improving electric lighting. In 1879, after thousands of experiments, Edison successfully developed a long-lasting incandescent bulb with a carbonized bamboo filament. He also developed a more efficient vacuum pump for evacuating the air from the bulb to create a vacuum, thereby reducing filament oxidation and prolonging bulb life.</p> <p>Commercialization of Electric Lighting: Thomas Edison's incandescent bulb marked the beginning of widespread commercial electric lighting. In 1882, Edison's Pearl Street Station in New York City became the first centralized electric power plant, providing electricity for electric lighting in nearby buildings. This event marked the birth of the modern electrical grid and the widespread adoption of electric lighting.</p> <p>Evolution of Bulb Technology: Over the years, incandescent bulbs underwent further improvements, including the use of better filament materials such as tungsten, which had a higher melting point and longer lifespan. However, incandescent bulbs remained relatively inefficient, with a significant portion of energy being converted into heat rather than light.</p> <p>Emergence of Alternative Lighting Technologies: In the late 20th century, concerns about energy efficiency and environmental impact led to the development of alternative lighting technologies such as fluorescent lamps, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs.

This process is governed by Joule's Law, which states that the heat produced in a conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current passing through it and its resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incandescence: As the filament heats up, it reaches extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 2,500 degrees Celsius (4,500 degrees Fahrenheit). At these temperatures, the filament begins to glow and emit light. This emission of light due to high temperature is called incandescence. The filament emits light across the visible spectrum, producing the characteristic warm glow of incandescent bulbs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Light Emission: The incandescent filament emits light in all directions, illuminating the surrounding area. However, a significant portion of the electrical energy is also converted into infrared radiation, which is not visible but contributes to the overall heat output of the bulb.</p> </li> <li> <p>Glass Envelope: The filament is enclosed within a glass bulb filled with inert gas, usually nitrogen or argon, which helps to prevent the filament from oxidizing and burning out too quickly. The glass envelope also serves to protect the filament from external contaminants and provides structural support for the bulb.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heat Dissipation: While incandescent bulbs primarily produce light, they also generate a considerable amount of heat as a byproduct of the filament's operation.

This is because the magnetic field lines in a toroidal core are mostly confined within the core itself, reducing magnetic flux leakage and maximizing the inductor's inductance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low Electromagnetic Interference (EMI): Toroidal inductors exhibit lower electromagnetic interference compared to other types of inductors. This is because the toroidal shape naturally minimizes the external magnetic field generated by the inductor, reducing the likelihood of interference with nearby electronic components.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compact Size: Toroidal inductors offer a high inductance-to-volume ratio, meaning they can provide a significant amount of inductance in a relatively compact package. This is advantageous in applications where space is limited, such as in small electronic devices or densely packed circuit boards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduced Core Losses: The closed-loop structure of the toroidal core results in reduced core losses, including hysteresis and eddy current losses. This contributes to the overall efficiency and stability of the inductor, especially in high-frequency applications where core losses can be significant.</p> </li> <li> <p>Uniform Magnetic Field Distribution: The toroidal shape ensures a more uniform distribution of magnetic flux throughout the core compared to other shapes.

The number of turns and the diameter of the wire determine the inductance of the inductor. More turns and/or smaller wire diameter generally result in higher inductance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inductance: When an electric current flows through the wire windings, it generates a magnetic field around the coil. The toroidal core concentrates this magnetic field, increasing the inductance of the inductor. The inductance is proportional to the number of turns squared and inversely proportional to the length of the coil.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inductive Reactance: In a circuit, the toroidal inductor exhibits inductive reactance, which is the opposition to changes in current flow. Inductive reactance (X_L) is proportional to the frequency of the alternating current passing through the inductor and the inductance (L) of the inductor, according to the formula X_L = 2\u03c0fL, where f is the frequency in hertz.</p> </li> <li> <p>Applications: Toroidal inductors find applications in various electronic circuits, including power supplies, audio equipment, RF filters, impedance matching networks, and electromagnetic interference suppression circuits.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In summary, the toroidal inductor's design features, including efficient magnetic coupling, low EMI, compact size, reduced core losses, and uniform magnetic field distribution, contribute to its effectiveness and versatility in electronic circuits.</p>"},{"location":"inductors/variable/","title":"Variable","text":""},{"location":"inductors/variable/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>Variable inductors, also known as adjustable inductors or variometers, have a fascinating history intertwined with the development of radio technology and early electronic circuits.

It is a great electrical component because it provides flexibility in controlling the flow of electric current within a circuit. Let's delve into how it works and why it's useful:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Adjustable Resistance: The primary function of a variable resistor is to vary the resistance in an electrical circuit. Resistance is a measure of how much a component opposes the flow of electric current. By adjusting the resistance of a variable resistor, you can control the amount of current flowing through a circuit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Construction: Variable resistors are typically constructed using a resistive element and a sliding contact, also known as a wiper. The resistive element can be made of materials like carbon, wirewound wire, or conductive plastic. It is often in the form of a track or a coil. The sliding contact moves along this resistive element, changing the amount of resistance encountered by the electric current.</p> </li> <li> <p>Functionality: When the sliding contact is moved along the resistive element, the effective length of the resistive path changes. This alters the amount of resistance in the circuit. For example, if the sliding contact is moved closer to one end of the resistive element, the resistance decreases, allowing more current to flow. Conversely, moving the sliding contact away from that end increases the resistance, reducing the current flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Voltage Divider: In the case of potentiometers, which have three terminals, they can also function as voltage dividers. By applying a voltage across the outer two terminals and tapping the voltage at the wiper terminal, you can obtain a variable voltage output that is a fraction of the input voltage. This is useful for applications such as volume control in audio equipment or brightness control in lighting systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Applications: Variable resistors find applications in various electronic circuits where adjustable resistance is required. Common uses include volume controls in audio devices, speed controls for motors, dimmer switches for lights, temperature controls in heaters and ovens, and tuning circuits in radios and amplifiers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Types: There are several types of variable resistors available, including rotary potentiometers, slide potentiometers, trimmers, and digital potentiometers.
