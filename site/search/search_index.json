Here's a simplified explanation of how a battery works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Anode: A battery has two terminals: an anode (negative terminal) and a cathode (positive terminal). Inside the battery, the anode is typically made of a reactive material, such as zinc or lithium. When the battery is connected to a circuit, the anode releases electrons due to a chemical reaction called oxidation. These electrons flow out of the battery through the external circuit, creating an electric current.</p> </li> <li> <p>Electrolyte: Between the anode and the cathode is an electrolyte, which is a substance that allows ions to move between the anode and cathode. The electrolyte can be a liquid, gel, or solid material. It facilitates the flow of ions within the battery, completing the electrical circuit and allowing the battery to function.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cathode: The cathode is made of a different reactive material, often a metal oxide or a conducting polymer. As the electrons flow through the external circuit, they travel from the anode to the cathode. At the same time, ions from the electrolyte move through the internal circuit of the battery to the cathode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduction Reaction: At the cathode, a reduction reaction occurs. This reaction involves the ions from the electrolyte combining with the electrons from the external circuit, resulting in a chemical change that stores energy in the battery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Electricity Generation: The flow of electrons through the external circuit provides electrical energy that can power devices connected to the battery. This energy is the result of the chemical reactions occurring within the battery, converting stored chemical energy into electrical energy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Discharge and Recharge: As the battery discharges, the reactive materials at the anode and cathode gradually change, and the concentration of ions in the electrolyte decreases. When the battery is connected to an external power source, such as during recharging, the electrochemical reactions are reversed, restoring the battery's stored energy for future use.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, a battery works by converting chemical energy into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions involving the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. This process allows batteries to store and release energy for various applications, from powering small electronic devices to storing renewable energy for use in electric vehicles and grid-scale storage systems.</p>","tags":["Hardware"]},{"location":"hardware/gpu/","title":"GPU","text":"<p>A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.

Various electrical components and systems control the operation of the vacuum cleaner and ensure efficient and effective cleaning.</p>","tags":["Home appliances"]},{"location":"physical_signals/linear_filter/","title":"Linear filter","text":""},{"location":"physical_signals/quasistatic/","title":"Electrical circuits in the quasistatic approximation","text":"","tags":["Physical signals"]},{"location":"physical_signals/quasistatic/#quasistatic-approximation","title":"Quasistatic approximation","text":"<p>In the quasistatic approximation, any variation in the source is immediately reflected to all the points of the circuit.</p> <p>Validity scope:</p> <p>The quasistatic approximation consists of neglecting the duration of propagation of the signal with respect to the characteristic evolution time physical quantities.</p> <p>Thus, in electrokinetics, we consider that the intensity of the current is the same at every point of a wire, neglecting in the propagation time.</p>","tags":["Physical signals"]},{"location":"physical_signals/quasistatic/#electrical-quantities","title":"Electrical quantities","text":"","tags":["Physical signals"]},{"location":"physical_signals/quasistatic/#electric-current","title":"Electric current","text":"<p>The electric current is associated with the macroscopic movement of the carriers of charge, electrons in the case of a metal.</p> <p>The intensity of the current, denoted i, is a charge rate equal to the electrical charge which passes through a section of the wire per unit of time:</p> <p></p> <p>with i the intensity in amperes (A), dq the elementary charge in coulombs (C) and dt the elementary duration in second (s).</p> <pre><code>Note: in the case of a steady state, we will note I = Q/T.\n</code></pre> <p>Measurement of electric current intensity:</p> <p>The intensity of the electric current is measured using an ammeter placed in series on the wire.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>In signal electronics, current intensities are of the order of tens of mA.</p> </li> <li> <p>For household appliances (bulb, kettle, etc.), intensities vary from 1 to 10 A.</p> </li> <li> <p>In electrical engineering, intensities can reach much higher values high (1000 A for a TGV engine).</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Physical signals"]},{"location":"physical_signals/quasistatic/#electrical-voltage","title":"Electrical voltage","text":"<p>Each point of the circuit is characterized by an electrical state: the electric potential.</p> <p>The electric voltage, denoted u<sub>AB</sub>, is equal to the electric potential difference between A and B.</p> <p>u<sub>AB</sub> = V<sub>A</sub> - V<sub>B</sub></p> <p>with V<sub>A</sub> and V<sub>B</sub> the potentials in A and B.
