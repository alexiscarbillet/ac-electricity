# Thermistor

## History

Thermistors, which are temperature-sensitive resistors, have a rich history in electrical engineering. Here are some historical facts about their use:

**Discovery**: The concept behind thermistors was first observed in the late 19th century. However, it wasn't until the 1930s that scientists began to understand and utilize the phenomenon more effectively.

**WWII Applications**: Thermistors gained significant attention during World War II for their application in temperature measurement and control systems, particularly in military equipment such as radar and early computing devices.

**Post-War Industrial Use**: After the war, thermistors found widespread use in industrial applications due to their accuracy, reliability, and relatively low cost compared to other temperature sensing technologies.

**Medical Equipment**: In the mid-20th century, thermistors became integral components in medical equipment, such as thermometers and incubators, where precise temperature control was critical.

**Consumer Electronics**: As technology advanced, thermistors found their way into consumer electronics, including home appliances like refrigerators, air conditioners, and ovens, where they are used for temperature monitoring and control.

**Automotive Industry**: Thermistors play a crucial role in modern automotive systems for engine temperature monitoring, cabin climate control, and battery management.

**Energy Efficiency**: In recent decades, thermistors have been employed in energy-efficient devices and systems, such as smart thermostats, where they contribute to improved energy management and conservation.

**Miniaturization and Integration**: Advances in manufacturing processes have led to the miniaturization and integration of thermistors into electronic circuits, enabling their use in compact and complex systems.

## How it works

A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance varies significantly with temperature. It's typically made of a semiconductor material, such as ceramic or metal oxide. The two most common types of thermistors are negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors.

Here's why thermistors are great electrical resistors and how they work:

1. **Temperature Sensitivity**: The key characteristic of a thermistor is its high sensitivity to temperature changes. Unlike standard resistors, which have a relatively constant resistance regardless of temperature, the resistance of a thermistor can change dramatically with even small variations in temperature. This property makes thermistors ideal for temperature sensing and control applications.

2. **Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) Thermistors**: NTC thermistors are the most common type. As the temperature increases, the resistance of an NTC thermistor decreases exponentially. This behavior is due to the increase in the number of charge carriers (electrons or holes) in the semiconductor material as the temperature rises, which results in a lower resistance.

3. **Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) Thermistors**: In contrast, PTC thermistors exhibit an increase in resistance with increasing temperature. This behavior occurs because the semiconductor material in PTC thermistors has a positive temperature coefficient of resistance. As the temperature rises, the resistance increases due to changes in the material's properties.

4. **Applications**: Thermistors find applications in various fields due to their temperature-sensitive nature. They are commonly used in temperature measurement, compensation, and control systems. For example, in a thermostat, a thermistor senses the temperature of a room or a device, and based on the resistance change, the system can adjust heating or cooling to maintain a desired temperature. Thermistors are also used in medical devices, automotive systems, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics.

5. **Accuracy and Precision**: Thermistors offer high accuracy and precision in temperature sensing compared to other temperature sensors like thermocouples or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). Their sensitivity to small temperature changes allows for precise temperature control in various applications.

6. **Simple Design and Integration**: Thermistors are relatively simple devices, consisting of just a semiconductor material with two leads. This simplicity makes them easy to integrate into electronic circuits, and their small size enables them to be used in compact devices and systems.

Overall, thermistors are valued for their temperature sensitivity, accuracy, and versatility, making them indispensable components in a wide range of electrical and electronic systems.
