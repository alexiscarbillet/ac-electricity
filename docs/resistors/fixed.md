# Fixed resistor

## History

Fixed resistors, also known as passive resistors, are fundamental components in electrical circuits that provide a predetermined level of resistance to the flow of electric current. Here are some historical facts about their use:

**Early Development**: The concept of resistance in electrical circuits dates back to the 19th century when scientists such as Georg Simon Ohm and James Clerk Maxwell laid the groundwork for understanding electrical resistance. However, early fixed resistors were typically made from materials like carbon or metal wire wound around an insulating core.

**Rise of Electronic Components**: With the development of electronic technology in the early 20th century, fixed resistors became essential components in radio, telegraph, and early computing systems. They were used in circuits to control current flow, set voltage levels, and divide voltage in various applications.

**Carbon Composition Resistors**: In the mid-20th century, carbon composition resistors became popular due to their stability, reliability, and relatively low cost. These resistors were made by mixing carbon powder with a binder material and forming it into a cylindrical shape. Carbon composition resistors were widely used in consumer electronics, industrial equipment, and telecommunications.

**Film Resistors**: In the latter half of the 20th century, film resistors began to replace carbon composition resistors in many applications. Film resistors are made by depositing a thin film of resistive material onto a ceramic or fiberglass substrate. They offer higher precision, better temperature stability, and lower noise compared to carbon composition resistors.

**Surface Mount Technology (SMT)**: With the advent of surface mount technology in the 1980s, surface mount resistors (SMD resistors) became the standard for compact electronic devices. SMD resistors are tiny components that can be mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB), allowing for smaller and lighter electronic devices.

**Integration and Miniaturization**: Advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes have enabled the integration and miniaturization of fixed resistors into integrated circuits (ICs) and microelectronic devices. These embedded resistors provide precise resistance values within the semiconductor chip itself, reducing the need for discrete components in electronic designs.

**Modern Applications**: Fixed resistors continue to be essential components in a wide range of electronic devices and systems, including computers, smartphones, automotive electronics, medical devices, and industrial automation. They are used in power supplies, voltage dividers, signal conditioning circuits, and many other applications where precise control of electrical currents and voltages is required.

## How it works

Fixed resistors are fundamental electrical components used to control the flow of electric current in a circuit by providing a specific level of resistance. Here's why fixed resistors are essential and how they work:

**1. Stability:** Fixed resistors offer stable and predictable resistance values over a wide range of operating conditions, including temperature, humidity, and voltage fluctuations. This stability ensures consistent performance in electronic circuits over time.

**2. Precision:** Fixed resistors are manufactured to precise tolerance levels, typically expressed as a percentage of the nominal resistance value. For example, a resistor with a tolerance of 1% means that its actual resistance will be within 1% of the specified value. This precision is crucial in applications where accurate resistance values are required for proper circuit operation.

**3. Reliability:** Fixed resistors are designed to withstand the rigors of electronic operation, including temperature extremes, mechanical stress, and environmental factors. They have a long operating life and low failure rates, making them reliable components in electronic systems.

**4. Versatility:** Fixed resistors are available in a wide range of resistance values, power ratings, and physical sizes to suit various application requirements. They can be used in simple circuits as well as complex electronic systems, making them versatile components in electrical engineering.

**5. Composition:** Fixed resistors can be made from different materials, including carbon composition, metal film, metal oxide, and wirewound. Each type of resistor has unique properties that make it suitable for specific applications. For example, carbon composition resistors offer stability and reliability, while metal film resistors provide high precision and low noise.

**6. Operation:** Fixed resistors work by converting electrical energy into heat as current flows through them. The resistance of a fixed resistor is determined by its material composition, physical dimensions, and temperature. Ohm's Law, which states that voltage (V) equals current (I) multiplied by resistance (R), governs the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit containing fixed resistors.

**7. Color Coding:** To identify the resistance value of a fixed resistor, manufacturers use a color code system consisting of colored bands printed on the resistor body. Each color represents a specific digit or multiplier, allowing engineers and technicians to determine the resistor's resistance value quickly and accurately.

### Color coding

Let's take a common 4-band color code used for carbon composition or metal film resistors. Each band represents a digit or a multiplier in the resistance value:

**First Band (1st digit)**: This band represents the first digit of the resistance value. Each color corresponds to a specific number:

    Black: 0
    Brown: 1
    Red: 2
    Orange: 3
    Yellow: 4
    Green: 5
    Blue: 6
    Violet: 7
    Gray: 8
    White: 9

**Second Band (2nd digit)**: This band represents the second digit of the resistance value and is similar to the first band.

**Third Band (Multiplier)**: This band represents the multiplier or the number of zeros to be added to the resistance value. Each color corresponds to a multiplier:

    Black: x1 (10^0)
    Brown: x10 (10^1)
    Red: x100 (10^2)
    Orange: x1,000 (10^3)
    Yellow: x10,000 (10^4)
    Green: x100,000 (10^5)
    Blue: x1,000,000 (10^6)
    Violet: x10,000,000 (10^7)
    Gray: x100,000,000 (10^8)
    White: x1,000,000,000 (10^9)

**Fourth Band (Tolerance)**: This band indicates the tolerance or the allowable deviation from the specified resistance value. Common tolerance values are:

    Gold: ±5%
    Silver: ±10%
    No Color (sometimes used for higher precision resistors): ±20%

Here's an example:

Suppose we have a resistor with the following color bands: Red, Green, Brown, Gold.

Using the color code:

    The first band (Red) represents the digit 2.
    The second band (Green) represents the digit 5.
    The third band (Brown) represents a multiplier of x10 (10^1).
    The fourth band (Gold) indicates a tolerance of ±5%.

Therefore, the resistance value of this resistor would be: 25 * 10^1 = 250 ohms with a tolerance of ±5%.
