# Varistor

## History

Varistors, short for variable resistors, are semiconductor devices with a nonlinear voltage-current characteristic. They are primarily used for surge protection in electrical circuits. While there isn't as extensive a historical record for varistors compared to other types of resistors, here are some key points about their development and usage:

**Early Development**: The concept of the varistor dates back to the early 20th century with the discovery of the voltage-dependent properties of certain semiconductor materials. However, it wasn't until the mid-20th century that varistors began to be mass-produced for commercial applications.

**Zinc Oxide Varistors (MOV)**: One of the most common types of varistors is the metal-oxide varistor (MOV), which is made from a ceramic material such as zinc oxide. MOVs were first developed in the 1950s and became widely used in surge protection applications due to their ability to rapidly change resistance in response to voltage spikes.

**Surge Protection Applications**: Varistors are primarily used for surge protection in electrical and electronic circuits. They are connected across power lines, signal lines, or communication lines to suppress voltage spikes and transient surges caused by lightning, switching events, or other electrical disturbances.

**Advancements in Technology**: Over the years, advancements in semiconductor technology and materials science have led to improvements in varistor performance, reliability, and response time. Modern varistors exhibit superior surge-handling capabilities and stability compared to early generations.

**Varistor Specifications and Standards**: Varistors are subject to industry standards and specifications, ensuring their compatibility and performance in various applications. Standards organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) provide guidelines for the design, testing, and rating of varistors.

**Diverse Applications**: In addition to surge protection, varistors are used in various other applications, including voltage regulation, electronic noise suppression, and signal conditioning. They are employed in consumer electronics, industrial equipment, telecommunications systems, and automotive electronics.

**Varistor Technology Evolution**: Besides MOVs, other types of varistors, such as silicon carbide (SiC) varistors and polymer-based varistors, have been developed to address specific application requirements. These varistors offer unique characteristics and performance advantages in different operating conditions.

## How it works

Varistors are semiconductor devices that exhibit nonlinear voltage-current characteristics, making them valuable components in electrical circuits, particularly for surge protection. Let's explore why varistors are great electrical resistors and how they work in detail:

### Construction:
- **Semiconductor Material**: Varistors are typically made from semiconductor materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO) or silicon carbide (SiC). These materials have unique properties that allow them to change resistance in response to changes in voltage.

- **Electrode Configuration**: Varistors are constructed with two electrodes, typically made from metal, that are connected to the semiconductor material. The electrodes allow for the application of voltage across the varistor and the measurement of current flowing through it.

- **Nonlinear Characteristics**: Unlike linear resistors, varistors exhibit nonlinear voltage-current characteristics. This means that their resistance varies with changes in applied voltage, providing high resistance under normal operating conditions and low resistance during voltage surges.

### Working Principle:
- **Zener Breakdown**: The operation of varistors is based on the phenomenon of Zener breakdown or avalanche breakdown in semiconductor materials. When the voltage across the varistor exceeds a certain threshold known as the breakdown voltage, the semiconductor material undergoes a rapid increase in conductivity, allowing current to flow through the varistor.

- **Clamping Voltage**: Once the breakdown voltage is reached, the varistor effectively clamps the voltage across its terminals to a safe level. This prevents the voltage from exceeding the breakdown voltage and protects downstream components from damage caused by voltage surges or transient events.

- **Transient Suppression**: Varistors are commonly used for surge protection in electrical circuits. When a voltage surge occurs, such as from lightning strikes or switching events, the varistor quickly responds by reducing the voltage to a safe level, diverting excess current away from sensitive components.

### Advantages:
1. **Fast Response**: Varistors respond rapidly to changes in voltage, providing instantaneous protection against voltage spikes and transient events.

2. **High Energy Absorption**: Varistors can absorb large amounts of energy during transient events, dissipating the energy as heat without damaging the varistor or other components in the circuit.

3. **Bidirectional Protection**: Varistors offer bidirectional protection, meaning they can suppress voltage surges in both positive and negative polarity.

4. **Reliability**: Varistors are highly reliable and have a long service life, making them suitable for continuous operation in demanding environments.

### Applications:
- **Surge Protection**: Varistors are primarily used for surge protection in electrical and electronic circuits, including power lines, signal lines, and communication lines.

- **Voltage Regulation**: Varistors can be used for voltage regulation and stabilization in power supplies and voltage reference circuits.

- **Noise Suppression**: Varistors are employed for electronic noise suppression in circuits where electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI) needs to be minimized.
