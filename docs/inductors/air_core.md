# Air core

## History

Air core inductors have a rich history in the development of electrical engineering. Here are some historical facts about their use:

**Early Experiments**: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pioneering electrical engineers like Nikola Tesla and Michael Faraday conducted experiments with inductors. Some of these early inductors used air cores due to the simplicity of construction and the absence of magnetic materials.

**Wireless Telegraphy**: During the development of wireless telegraphy (early radio), air core inductors were commonly used in radio frequency (RF) circuits. They were essential components in the tuning circuits of early radio receivers and transmitters.

**Inductive Coupling**: Air core inductors were used in various forms of inductive coupling systems, including transformers and resonant circuits. These applications were crucial in the development of early electrical systems for power distribution and communication.

**RF Circuits and Antennas**: In RF circuits and antenna design, air core inductors are still widely used today. They are employed in filters, impedance matching networks, and antenna tuners across a range of radio communication systems.

**Advantages and Disadvantages**: Air core inductors offer advantages such as high Q-factor (quality factor), low loss, and tolerance to high temperatures. However, they typically have lower inductance values compared to iron core inductors, which may necessitate larger physical sizes for equivalent performance.

**Specialized Applications**: In certain specialized applications where magnetic materials would interfere with the operation, such as in some medical devices or high-frequency communication equipment, air core inductors remain indispensable components.

**Modern Developments**: Despite the availability of more advanced materials like ferrite and powdered iron for inductor cores, air core inductors continue to find applications in fields like RF engineering, where their unique characteristics are advantageous.

## How it works

Air core inductors are considered great inductors for several reasons, and understanding how they work can shed light on their effectiveness:

1. **Low Losses**: Air core inductors have lower core losses compared to inductors with ferromagnetic cores (such as iron or ferrite cores). This is because air has negligible magnetic permeability, meaning it doesn't retain magnetism like ferromagnetic materials do. As a result, there are minimal energy losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents.

2. **High Q-Factor**: The Q-factor, or quality factor, of an inductor measures its efficiency by comparing the energy stored to the energy dissipated as heat. Air core inductors typically have higher Q-factors than those with ferromagnetic cores. This is because air core inductors have lower resistance and core losses, allowing them to store energy more efficiently.

3. **Linear Response**: Air core inductors exhibit a linear response to changes in current and magnetic field strength. This means that their inductance remains relatively constant over a wide range of operating conditions. In contrast, inductors with ferromagnetic cores may exhibit non-linear behavior due to saturation effects.

4. **Tolerance to High Frequencies**: Air core inductors are well-suited for high-frequency applications because they have minimal core losses and can operate effectively at frequencies where ferromagnetic cores may experience significant losses due to eddy currents and magnetic hysteresis.

Now, let's delve into how air core inductors work in more detail:

- **Basic Principle**: An inductor resists changes in current flow by storing energy in a magnetic field when current passes through it. When the current through an inductor changes, the magnetic field surrounding the inductor changes as well. This changing magnetic field induces a voltage (according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction) that opposes the change in current, resulting in a self-induced voltage or back electromotive force (EMF) across the inductor.

- **Construction**: An air core inductor consists of a coil of wire wound around a non-magnetic core, typically made of air or a non-magnetic material like plastic or ceramic. The coil's turns are usually wound close together to maximize magnetic coupling and minimize resistance.

- **Inductance**: The inductance of an air core inductor depends on factors such as the number of turns in the coil, the cross-sectional area of the coil, the length of the coil, and the permeability of the surrounding medium (which is nearly constant and close to 1 for air). The inductance \( L \) of an air core inductor can be calculated using the formula:
  
  \[ L = \frac{{\mu_0 \cdot N^2 \cdot A}}{{l}} \]

  where:
  - \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space (a constant, approximately \( 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \) H/m),
  - \( N \) is the number of turns in the coil,
  - \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the coil, and
  - \( l \) is the length of the coil.

- **Applications**: Air core inductors find applications in a wide range of fields, including radio frequency (RF) circuits, high-frequency communication systems, antennas, impedance matching networks, and filters. Their low loss, high Q-factor, and linear response make them particularly suitable for these applications.
