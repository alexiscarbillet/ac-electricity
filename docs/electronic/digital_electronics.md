## Digitization of Analog Signals

### Interest in Digitization

The digitization of analog signals is crucial in modern technology for several reasons:

1. **Storage and Processing**: Digital signals can be easily stored, manipulated, and processed using computers and digital devices. This allows for efficient data handling, analysis, and transformation.

2. **Noise Immunity**: Digital signals are less susceptible to noise and interference compared to analog signals. Once converted to digital form, signals can be transmitted over long distances with minimal degradation.

3. **Reproducibility**: Digital data can be copied and transmitted without loss of quality. This is essential for applications like music, video, and data communication.

4. **Compression and Encryption**: Digitization allows for techniques such as compression (to reduce file size) and encryption (to secure data), which are critical in many applications.

5. **Integration**: Digital systems can integrate easily with modern computing and communication technologies, enabling advanced functionalities and smart applications.

### Principle of Digitization
The digitization process of analog signals typically involves two main steps: **Sampling** and **Quantization**.

#### **Sampling**:

   - Sampling is the process of measuring the amplitude of an analog signal at discrete intervals of time. The rate at which the signal is sampled is known as the sampling rate (or sampling frequency).
   - According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to accurately reconstruct the original signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the analog signal:

\[
f_s \geq 2f_{max}
\]

   - Here, \(f_s\) is the sampling frequency and \(f_{max}\) is the maximum frequency of the analog signal. If this criterion is not met, aliasing can occur, leading to distortion in the reconstructed signal.

#### **Quantization**:

   - After sampling, each sample's amplitude must be represented by a finite number of levels. This process is called quantization.
   - Quantization involves mapping the continuous amplitude values of the sampled signal to a set of discrete values (quantization levels). The number of levels is determined by the bit depth (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit), which defines how many distinct amplitude values can be represented.
   - For example, with an 8-bit system, there are \(2^8 = 256\) possible levels. The quantization error is the difference between the actual analog value and the quantized digital value.

#### **Encoding**:

   - Finally, each quantized value is converted into a binary format (0s and 1s) for storage or transmission. This binary representation allows the digital signal to be processed by computers and digital devices.

## Digital Filtering

Digital filtering is a crucial technique in signal processing that allows for the manipulation and enhancement of signals in the digital domain. It can be used to remove noise, extract important features, or shape the frequency response of signals.

### Analog Filters

**Analog filters** are circuits that process continuous-time signals. They use passive components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors) or active components (operational amplifiers) to filter signals based on their frequency content. Common types of analog filters include:

1. **Low-Pass Filter (LPF)**: Allows signals with frequencies lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating higher frequencies.
2. **High-Pass Filter (HPF)**: Allows signals with frequencies higher than a certain cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating lower frequencies.
3. **Band-Pass Filter (BPF)**: Allows a specific range of frequencies to pass while attenuating frequencies outside that range.
4. **Band-Stop Filter (BSF)**: Attenuates a specific range of frequencies while allowing others to pass.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Frequency Response**: Describes how the amplitude and phase of the output signal vary with frequency.
- **Design Parameters**: Includes cutoff frequency, gain, and order of the filter, which determine its performance.

### Digital Filters

**Digital filters** process discrete-time signals (i.e., signals that have been sampled and quantized). They perform filtering operations through algorithms implemented in software or dedicated hardware. Digital filters can be classified into two main categories:

#### **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters**:

   - FIR filters have a finite duration of impulse response, meaning they use a finite number of past input values to produce the output.
   - They are inherently stable and can be designed to have a linear phase response, making them suitable for applications where phase distortion is critical.
   - The output is calculated as:
   
\[
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k \cdot x[n-k]
\]

where \(y[n]\) is the output, \(x[n-k]\) are the input samples, \(b_k\) are the filter coefficients, and \(M\) is the order of the filter.

#### **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filters**:

   - IIR filters have an infinite duration of impulse response, meaning they use both past input values and past output values in their calculations.
   - They are typically more efficient in terms of computation compared to FIR filters because they can achieve a desired frequency response with fewer coefficients.
   - The output is calculated as:

\[
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k \cdot x[n-k] - \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j \cdot y[n-j]
\]

where \(a_j\) are the feedback coefficients, and \(N\) is the order of the filter.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Stability**: Digital filters can be designed for stability, but IIR filters require careful design to ensure that they do not produce unbounded output.
- **Flexibility**: Digital filters can be easily reconfigured and updated through software changes, making them highly versatile for different applications.
- **Precision**: Digital filtering allows for high precision in calculations due to the nature of digital computation.
