# Silicon Carbide

## History

Silicon Carbide (SiC) has a long history of being used as a semiconductor material for electricity, with notable developments and milestones in its utilization. Here are some historical facts:

**Early Discovery**: The existence of silicon carbide dates back to the early 19th century when it was first discovered by Edward Goodrich Acheson in 1891 while he was attempting to produce artificial diamonds. Acheson accidentally synthesized silicon carbide through the reaction of carbon with silicon at high temperatures in an electric furnace.

**Early Semiconductor Applications**: Silicon carbide's semiconductor properties were recognized in the early 20th century. However, its use as a semiconductor material was limited due to challenges in processing and fabrication techniques.

**World War II**: During World War II, silicon carbide gained attention for its potential use in radar applications due to its high thermal conductivity and stability at high temperatures. It was employed in early radar systems and microwave electronics.

**1950s-1960s**: In the post-war period, research into silicon carbide as a semiconductor material intensified. Its wide bandgap and high-temperature stability made it an attractive candidate for high-power and high-temperature electronic applications.

**1970s-1980s**: Significant progress was made in developing methods for producing high-quality silicon carbide crystals suitable for semiconductor applications. Researchers focused on improving crystal growth techniques such as the sublimation method and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).

**1990s**: The commercialization of silicon carbide as a semiconductor material began to gain momentum in the 1990s. Companies such as Cree, Inc. started producing SiC-based devices for power electronics applications.

**Advancements in Power Electronics**: Silicon carbide's superior properties, including high breakdown voltage, high thermal conductivity, and high-temperature operation, led to its widespread adoption in power electronics applications. SiC-based devices such as Schottky diodes, MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors), and JFETs (Junction Field-Effect Transistors) offered significant performance advantages over traditional silicon-based devices in terms of efficiency, power density, and operating temperature.

**21st Century**: In the 21st century, the use of silicon carbide in power electronics continued to grow rapidly. Its adoption expanded beyond niche applications into mainstream markets such as electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems (solar and wind), industrial motor drives, and grid infrastructure.

**Ongoing Research and Development**: Research efforts in silicon carbide semiconductor technology continue to focus on improving material quality, device performance, and cost-effectiveness. Advances in fabrication techniques, packaging technologies, and device architectures aim to further enhance the capabilities and competitiveness of SiC-based devices.

## How it works

Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a semiconductor material that works based on similar principles as other semiconductors like silicon (Si), but with some distinct advantages due to its unique properties. Here's a detailed explanation of how SiC works:

**Crystal Structure**: Silicon carbide crystallizes in a variety of crystal structures, but the most commonly used form for semiconductor applications is the hexagonal polytype known as 4H-SiC or 6H-SiC. In these crystal structures, silicon (Si) and carbon (C) atoms are arranged in a lattice, forming a semiconductor material with unique electronic properties.

**Band Structure**: SiC has a wide bandgap, typically around 2.3 to 3.3 electron volts (eV) depending on the polytype and doping. The bandgap is the energy difference between the valence band (where electrons are bound to atoms) and the conduction band (where electrons are free to move as charge carriers). The wide bandgap of SiC allows it to withstand higher electric fields and operate at higher temperatures compared to silicon, making it suitable for high-power and high-temperature applications.

**Doping**: Like silicon, SiC can be doped with impurities to modify its electrical properties. Doping introduces either excess electrons (n-type doping) or electron deficiencies called "holes" (p-type doping) into the semiconductor material. Common dopants for SiC include nitrogen (N) and aluminum (Al) for n-type doping, and boron (B) for p-type doping.

**Operation**:

   - **Transistors**: SiC-based transistors, such as Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) and Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), utilize the properties of SiC to control the flow of current through the device. In a MOSFET, for example, the gate voltage applied to the device modulates the conductivity of the SiC channel between the source and drain terminals, allowing for the amplification or switching of electrical signals.

   - **Diodes**: SiC-based diodes, such as Schottky diodes, exploit the properties of the semiconductor's bandgap to facilitate the flow of current in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. This property is essential for rectification (conversion of alternating current to direct current) and in various electronic circuits.

   - **Optoelectronic Devices**: SiC is also used in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors. In these devices, the bandgap of SiC determines the energy of photons (light particles) emitted or absorbed by the material, enabling the generation, detection, and modulation of light signals.

**Applications**:

   - SiC-based semiconductor devices find applications in power electronics, automotive systems, renewable energy systems (such as solar inverters and wind turbines), industrial motor drives, aerospace, and telecommunications.

   - SiC's high breakdown voltage, high thermal conductivity, and high-temperature operation make it particularly suitable for high-power and high-frequency applications where traditional silicon devices may struggle to perform efficiently.
