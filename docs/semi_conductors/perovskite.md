# Perovskite

## History

Perovskite semiconductors have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their promising applications in a wide range of electronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors. Below are key historical milestones in the development and application of perovskite materials:

**Discovery**: The mineral perovskite was first discovered in the Ural Mountains of Russia in the early 19th century by Russian mineralogist Gustav Rose. It was named after Lev Perovski, then president of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

**Semiconductor Properties**: Although the perovskite crystal structure was well-known, its semiconductor properties were not extensively explored until the late 20th century. Researchers began investigating perovskite materials for electronics due to their advantageous properties: high carrier mobility, long diffusion lengths, and tunable bandgaps.

**Early Applications**: Initially, perovskite materials were studied for use in thin-film transistors and LEDs. However, their true potential emerged in the early 2010s when they were applied in photovoltaic devices.

**Breakthrough in Solar Cells**: In 2009, Japanese researchers demonstrated the use of perovskite materials as light-absorbing layers in solar cells, achieving a power conversion efficiency of approximately 3.8%. Since then, there has been a rapid progression, with laboratory efficiencies surpassing 25% by 2022.

**Commercialization Efforts**: Numerous companies and academic institutions are now actively pursuing the commercialization of perovskite-based solar cells and related devices. While commercial products remain in development, interest and investment in this field continue to grow.

**Challenges and Opportunities**: Despite their promise, perovskite materials face several challenges. These include stability issues under ambient conditions and concerns about lead toxicity in some formulations. Ongoing research aims to improve environmental safety and long-term durability through the development of more stable and lead-free alternatives.

## How It Works

Perovskite semiconductors are defined by their distinctive crystal structure, typically represented as **ABX₃**, where "A" and "B" are cations and "X" is an anion. This 3D framework forms the basis for their excellent optoelectronic properties.

In solar cells, perovskites serve as the light-absorbing material. Here's how a perovskite solar cell operates:

1. **Light Absorption**: Incoming sunlight is absorbed by the perovskite layer. Photons with energy equal to or greater than the material's bandgap excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band.

2. **Electron-Hole Pair Generation**: Absorbed photons generate electron-hole pairs (also called excitons). These carriers must be separated and directed to generate electricity.

3. **Charge Separation**: At the interface with the **electron transport layer (ETL)**—commonly made of titanium dioxide (TiO₂)—electrons are extracted from the perovskite, while holes remain and migrate toward the **hole transport layer (HTL)**.

4. **Carrier Transport**: Electrons flow through the ETL to the cathode, while holes move through the HTL—often made of materials like spiro-OMeTAD—toward the anode.

5. **Power Generation**: The movement of these charge carriers through an external circuit generates an electric current, producing usable electrical power.

6. **Minimizing Recombination**: Efficient devices minimize the recombination of electrons and holes (which would otherwise reduce performance by converting energy into heat or light).

7. **External Circuit Use**: The generated current can directly power devices or be stored in batteries. Efficiency depends on factors such as the quality of the perovskite film, energy alignment of layers, and device architecture.

### Advantages and Challenges

**Advantages**:

* **High Efficiency**: Rapid improvements have made perovskites competitive with traditional silicon solar cells.
* **Low-Cost Fabrication**: Solution-based processes enable low-temperature and scalable manufacturing.
* **Material Tunability**: Bandgap and properties can be tuned via chemical composition, enabling multi-junction applications.

**Challenges**:

* **Stability**: Perovskite materials degrade when exposed to moisture, oxygen, UV light, or heat.
* **Toxicity**: Many perovskite compounds contain lead, raising environmental and safety concerns.
