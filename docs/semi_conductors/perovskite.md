# Perovskite

## History

Perovskite semiconductors have gained significant attention in recent years for their potential applications in various electronic devices, including solar cells, LEDs, and photodetectors. Here are some historical facts about the use of perovskite semiconductors:

**Discovery**: Perovskite minerals were first discovered in the Ural Mountains of Russia in the early 19th century by the Russian mineralogist Gustav Rose. The name "perovskite" is derived from the Russian mineralogist Lev Perovski, who was the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences at the time.

**Semiconductor Properties**: While perovskite minerals were known for their crystal structure, it wasn't until the late 20th century that their semiconductor properties were extensively studied. Researchers began to explore the potential of perovskite materials for use in electronic devices due to their unique combination of properties, including high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion lengths, and tunable bandgaps.

**Early Applications**: Perovskite materials were initially used in various research applications, such as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, it wasn't until the early 2010s that perovskite solar cells started to gain attention for their high efficiency and low-cost fabrication methods.

**Solar Cells**: In 2009, Japanese researchers first demonstrated the use of perovskite materials as light harvesters in solar cells, achieving a power conversion efficiency of around 3.8%. Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, with record efficiencies exceeding 25% in laboratory settings as of 2022.

**Commercialization Efforts**: Several companies and research institutions are actively working on commercializing perovskite-based solar cells and other electronic devices. While commercial products based on perovskite semiconductors are still in the early stages of development, there is significant investment and research interest in this area.

**Challenges and Opportunities**: Despite their promising properties, perovskite materials also pose challenges, such as stability issues under ambient conditions and toxicity concerns associated with certain lead-containing compositions. Researchers are actively working to address these challenges through the development of more stable and environmentally friendly perovskite formulations.

## How it works

Perovskite semiconductors are a class of materials that exhibit a unique crystal structure known as the perovskite structure. This structure consists of a three-dimensional network of metal cations surrounded by anions in octahedral coordination.

In the context of solar cells, perovskite semiconductors are used as the light-absorbing layer. Here's a detailed explanation of how perovskite solar cells work:

1. **Light Absorption**: When sunlight strikes the surface of the perovskite solar cell, photons (light particles) with energy higher than the bandgap of the perovskite material are absorbed. The bandgap determines the minimum energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band.

2. **Generation of Electron-Hole Pairs**: Upon absorbing photons, the perovskite material generates electron-hole pairs. Electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band, leaving behind positively charged holes in the valence band.

3. **Charge Separation**: The electron-hole pairs are then separated at the interface between the perovskite layer and the electron transport layer (usually titanium dioxide, TiO2). Electrons migrate towards the electron transport layer, while the holes remain in the perovskite layer.

4. **Carrier Transport**: The separated electrons move through the electron transport layer towards the conductive electrode (typically made of a material like gold or silver), while the holes move through the perovskite layer towards the hole transport layer (usually made of a material like spiro-OMeTAD).

5. **Electrical Current Generation**: As electrons flow through the external circuit from the electron transport layer to the conductive electrode and holes flow through the hole transport layer, an electrical current is generated, providing usable electrical power.

6. **Recombination**: To maintain the current flow, it's essential to minimize the recombination of electrons and holes within the device. Recombination occurs when an electron recombines with a hole, releasing energy in the form of heat or light, which reduces the efficiency of the solar cell.

7. **External Circuit**: The generated electrical current can be utilized to power electronic devices or stored in a battery for later use. The efficiency of the solar cell is determined by factors such as the bandgap of the perovskite material, the quality of the interfaces between different layers, and the overall device architecture.

Perovskite solar cells offer several advantages over traditional silicon-based solar cells, including lower production costs, potential for higher efficiency, and the ability to be fabricated using solution-based processes, which can be scalable and suitable for large-scale manufacturing. However, challenges such as stability under real-world operating conditions and toxicity concerns associated with certain perovskite formulations remain areas of active research and development.
