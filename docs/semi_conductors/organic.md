# Organic

## History

Organic semiconductors represent a class of materials composed of carbon-based molecules or polymers that exhibit semiconducting properties. Here are some historical facts about the use of organic semiconductors in electronics:

**Discovery of Organic Semiconductors (Late 19th Century - Early 20th Century)**: The earliest observations of semiconducting behavior in organic materials date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Scientists observed that certain organic compounds, such as anthracene and phthalocyanine derivatives, exhibited electrical conductivity when doped with impurities.

**Early Research (Mid-20th Century)**: The study of organic semiconductors gained momentum in the mid-20th century with the discovery of materials such as polyacetylene, which exhibited semiconducting properties. Researchers began to explore the potential applications of organic semiconductors in electronic devices.

**Development of Conducting Polymers (1970s - 1980s)**: In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers made significant advancements in the field of conducting polymers, which are organic materials that can conduct electricity. Conducting polymers such as polyacetylene, polyaniline, and polythiophene were developed and studied for their electronic properties.

**Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)**: One of the earliest practical applications of organic semiconductors was in the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, researchers demonstrated the feasibility of using organic materials as the active layer in light-emitting diodes. OLEDs offered advantages such as high efficiency, low power consumption, and flexibility, paving the way for applications in displays, lighting, and signage.

**Organic Thin-Film Transistors (OTFTs)**: Organic semiconductors have also been used in the development of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). OTFTs are electronic devices that utilize organic semiconductors as the active layer in the transistor structure. OTFTs offer advantages such as low-cost fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and compatibility with large-area electronics.

**Advancements in Materials and Device Performance (21st Century)**: In the 21st century, there have been significant advancements in the development of organic semiconductors, including the discovery of new materials with improved charge transport properties and stability. These advancements have led to the commercialization of organic electronics in various applications, including displays, sensors, photovoltaics, and wearable devices.

**Challenges and Opportunities**: Despite their promise, organic semiconductors also face challenges such as limited charge mobility, stability issues, and manufacturing scalability. Researchers continue to work on addressing these challenges through the development of new materials, fabrication techniques, and device architectures.

## How it works

Organic semiconductors are a class of materials that exhibit semiconducting behavior due to the presence of conjugated π-electron systems. Here's a detailed explanation of how organic semiconductors work:

**Molecular Structure**: Organic semiconductors are typically composed of carbon-based molecules or polymers with alternating single and multiple bonds, creating a π-conjugated system. This conjugated structure allows for delocalization of π-electrons along the molecule or polymer chain.

**Energy Levels**: In organic semiconductors, the π-electrons occupy molecular orbitals that form valence and conduction bands, similar to inorganic semiconductors. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) determines the material's bandgap.

**Electrical Conductivity**: At room temperature, organic semiconductors behave as insulators due to the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO. However, by doping the material with impurities or applying an external electric field, it's possible to introduce charge carriers (electrons or holes) into the semiconductor, thereby increasing its electrical conductivity.

**Charge Transport**: In organic semiconductors, charge transport occurs through the movement of charge carriers (electrons or holes) along the conjugated π-electron system. The mobility of charge carriers depends on factors such as the crystallinity of the material, the purity of the semiconductor, and the presence of defects.

**Device Operation**:

   - **Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)**: In OLEDs, organic semiconductors are used as the active layers. When a voltage is applied across the OLED device, electrons and holes are injected into the organic semiconductor layers from the cathode and anode, respectively. The recombination of electrons and holes at the interface of the organic layers results in the emission of light.

   - **Organic Thin-Film Transistors (OTFTs)**: In OTFTs, organic semiconductors serve as the active channels between the source and drain electrodes. By applying a voltage to the gate electrode, it's possible to modulate the conductivity of the organic semiconductor layer, thereby controlling the flow of current between the source and drain electrodes.

**Advantages**:

   - **Flexibility**: Organic semiconductors can be processed using solution-based techniques, allowing for the fabrication of flexible and conformable electronic devices.

   - **Low-Cost Fabrication**: Organic semiconductors can be deposited onto substrates using techniques such as inkjet printing, roll-to-roll coating, and vacuum deposition, enabling low-cost and scalable manufacturing.

   - **Tunable Properties**: The properties of organic semiconductors can be tuned through chemical synthesis, allowing for the optimization of device performance and functionality.

**Challenges**:

   - **Limited Charge Mobility**: Organic semiconductors typically exhibit lower charge carrier mobility compared to inorganic semiconductors, which can limit the performance of organic electronic devices.

   - **Stability**: Organic semiconductors are often susceptible to degradation when exposed to oxygen, moisture, and light, necessitating the development of encapsulation techniques and stable materials.
