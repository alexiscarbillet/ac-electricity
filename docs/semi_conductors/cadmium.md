# Cadmium Tellurite

## History

Here are some historical facts about the use of cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor for electricity:

**Discovery and Early Research (1950s-1960s)**: Cadmium telluride was first synthesized and studied for its semiconductor properties in the mid-20th century. Early research focused on understanding its electronic structure, optical properties, and potential applications in electronic devices.

**Application in Radiation Detectors (1960s-1970s)**: One of the earliest practical applications of cadmium telluride was in the field of radiation detection. CdTe proved to be effective in detecting X-rays and gamma rays due to its high atomic number (Cd: 48, Te: 52) and high density, which result in strong interaction with ionizing radiation.

**Development of Thin-Film Solar Cells (1980s-1990s)**: The potential of cadmium telluride as a material for solar cells was recognized in the 1980s. Researchers began to explore the use of CdTe thin films in photovoltaic devices due to its favorable optical and electronic properties, including a direct bandgap and high absorption coefficient for sunlight.

**Commercialization of CdTe Solar Cells (2000s-present)**: The commercialization of cadmium telluride thin-film solar cells began to gain momentum in the early 2000s. Companies such as First Solar, Inc. played a significant role in scaling up production and reducing manufacturing costs, leading to the widespread deployment of CdTe solar modules in utility-scale solar power plants.

**Efficiency Improvements and Market Penetration**: Over the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in the efficiency and performance of CdTe solar cells. First Solar achieved a world-record efficiency of over 22% for CdTe thin-film modules in research settings, while commercially available modules typically have efficiencies ranging from 15% to 18%. CdTe solar technology has become increasingly competitive with traditional silicon-based solar cells, capturing a significant share of the global solar market.

**Environmental and Safety Concerns**: Despite its commercial success, the use of cadmium in CdTe solar cells has raised environmental and safety concerns due to the toxicity of cadmium. Efforts have been made to minimize the environmental impact of CdTe manufacturing processes and to develop recycling methods for end-of-life solar modules to mitigate potential risks.

## How it works

Here's a detailed explanation of how cadmium telluride (CdTe) works as a semiconductor for electricity, particularly in the context of thin-film solar cells:

1. **Bandgap and Absorption**: CdTe is a semiconductor with a direct bandgap, meaning that the energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band corresponds to a specific photon energy. This property makes CdTe an efficient absorber of sunlight, as photons with energies greater than the bandgap can generate electron-hole pairs within the material.

2. **Photovoltaic Effect**: In a thin-film solar cell, a layer of CdTe is deposited onto a substrate, typically glass or a flexible material. When sunlight strikes the CdTe layer, photons with energies greater than the bandgap are absorbed, creating electron-hole pairs.

3. **Carrier Separation**: The absorbed photons generate electron-hole pairs within the CdTe layer. Due to the internal electric field within the semiconductor, the electrons are driven towards the n-type (electron-rich) region of the CdTe layer, while the holes are driven towards the p-type (hole-rich) region.

4. **Electrical Current Generation**: The separated electrons and holes create a flow of electrical current within the solar cell. The electrons travel through the CdTe layer to the electron-collecting electrode (typically made of a material like aluminum), while the holes travel to the hole-collecting electrode (typically made of a material like copper). This flow of electrons constitutes the electrical output of the solar cell.

5. **External Circuit**: The generated electrical current can be utilized to power electronic devices or stored in a battery for later use. The efficiency of the solar cell depends on factors such as the bandgap of the CdTe material, the quality of the interfaces between different layers, and the overall device architecture.

6. **Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) Layer**: In addition to the CdTe layer, thin-film solar cells typically include a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), on the front surface of the cell. This TCO layer serves as a transparent electrode, allowing sunlight to pass through to the CdTe layer while facilitating the collection of electrons generated by photon absorption.

7. **Back Contact**: On the back surface of the solar cell, a metal contact layer is typically deposited to collect the holes generated within the CdTe layer. This metal contact layer completes the electrical circuit and allows for the extraction of electrical power from the solar cell.
