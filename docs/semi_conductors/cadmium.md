# Cadmium Telluride

## History

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a compound semiconductor that has become a cornerstone in the development of thin-film photovoltaic technology. Below is an overview of its historical development and applications:

### **Discovery and Early Research (1950s–1960s)**

CdTe was first synthesized and studied in the mid-20th century for its semiconductor characteristics. Early investigations focused on its electronic structure, optical behavior, and suitability for use in electronic components, laying the groundwork for its future applications.

### **Radiation Detection Applications (1960s–1970s)**

CdTe found one of its earliest commercial uses in radiation detection. Its high atomic numbers (Cd: 48, Te: 52) and density allow it to interact strongly with ionizing radiation, making it highly effective for detecting X-rays and gamma rays. This made it valuable in medical imaging and industrial inspection tools.

### **Advances in Photovoltaics (1980s–1990s)**

Interest in CdTe as a material for solar energy conversion grew during the 1980s. Its direct bandgap (\~1.45 eV) and high absorption coefficient made it ideal for capturing sunlight efficiently. Researchers began developing CdTe thin-film solar cells, which offered the potential for lower-cost manufacturing compared to traditional crystalline silicon cells.

### **Commercialization and Scaling (2000s–Present)**

The early 2000s saw the rise of commercial CdTe solar cells, with First Solar, Inc. emerging as a leader in large-scale production. Continuous improvements in manufacturing processes significantly reduced costs and enabled the deployment of CdTe modules in large utility-scale solar farms worldwide.

### **Efficiency Milestones and Market Growth**

Over the last two decades, technological advancements have driven steady improvements in CdTe solar cell efficiency. First Solar has achieved over 22% efficiency in laboratory conditions, while commercial modules typically operate at 15–18%. CdTe technology now represents a significant share of the global solar market and continues to rival traditional silicon-based solutions.

### **Environmental and Safety Considerations**

Despite its benefits, the inclusion of cadmium—a toxic heavy metal—raises environmental and health concerns. Industry efforts have focused on minimizing emissions during production, implementing closed-loop recycling for end-of-life modules, and developing safer handling practices to mitigate ecological risks.

## How It Works

CdTe functions as a key semiconductor material in thin-film solar cells, converting sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. Here's how the process works:

### Bandgap and Light Absorption

CdTe possesses a direct bandgap of approximately 1.45 eV, which aligns well with the solar spectrum. This enables efficient absorption of sunlight and the generation of electron-hole pairs (charge carriers) when photons with sufficient energy excite electrons across the bandgap.

### Photovoltaic Effect

In a CdTe solar cell, a thin CdTe layer is deposited onto a substrate—usually glass or a flexible polymer. Upon exposure to sunlight, the CdTe absorbs photons and produces electron-hole pairs.

### Charge Carrier Separation

The CdTe layer is typically combined with a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer to form a p-n junction. This junction creates an internal electric field that separates the charge carriers: electrons are directed toward the n-type region, while holes move toward the p-type region.

### Electric Current Generation

Separated electrons and holes travel to their respective electrodes. Electrons flow toward the front contact (typically a transparent conductive oxide like ITO), while holes move to the back contact (usually made of metals like molybdenum or copper). This movement generates a direct current (DC).

### External Circuit Integration

The generated current flows through an external circuit, powering connected devices or charging batteries. The total electrical output depends on several factors, including the quality of the CdTe layer, interface engineering, and overall cell architecture.

### Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) Layer

The front contact includes a TCO layer, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), which serves a dual function: it allows light to penetrate the active layers while also conducting the generated electrons out of the cell.

### Back Contact

The rear side of the solar cell features a metallic back contact that collects holes and completes the electrical circuit. The design and composition of this contact layer are critical for minimizing resistance and enhancing long-term stability.
