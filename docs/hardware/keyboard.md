# Keyboard

## History

Keyboards have evolved significantly since their creation, adapting alongside technology and user demands.

**Early Typewriters (19th Century):**  
The origins of modern keyboards trace back to the typewriter. The first commercially successful model, patented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and Samuel W. Soule, introduced a layout resembling today’s QWERTY design.

**Telegraph and Early Keyboards (19th Century):**  
Before typewriters, telegraph operators used devices known as "telegraph keys" to send Morse code. These early instruments were among the first input devices to translate physical actions into communication signals.

**QWERTY Layout (1870s):**  
The QWERTY layout, named after the first six letters on the top row, was created by Sholes to reduce jamming in mechanical typewriters. Despite later alternatives, QWERTY remains the standard keyboard layout worldwide.

**Electric Typewriters and Computer Terminals (20th Century):**  
The arrival of electric typewriters brought smoother typing and adjustable key resistance. Eventually, keyboards became integral to computer terminals, allowing interaction with early mainframes through typed commands.

**Computer Keyboards (1960s–1970s):**  
As personal computing emerged, keyboards became the primary interface for data input. Models like the IBM 3270 and DEC VT100 featured mechanical switches and function keys for navigating text-based systems.

**Membrane Keyboards (1970s–present):**  
Introduced in the 1970s, membrane keyboards replaced individual switches with flexible layers. They are quieter, cheaper to produce, and widely used in modern devices, though often less tactile than mechanical types.

**Mechanical Keyboards Resurgence (2010s–present):**  
In recent years, mechanical keyboards have regained popularity for their tactile feel, switch variety, and long lifespan. They are favored by gamers, typists, and professionals seeking a precise and responsive typing experience.

**Ergonomic and Alternative Layouts:**  
Designers have also focused on ergonomics, creating split and curved keyboards to reduce strain. Alternative layouts like Dvorak and Colemak aim to improve comfort and typing speed, though QWERTY still dominates everyday use.

## How it works

A keyboard is an input device that sends characters, symbols, and commands to a computer or electronic system. Its operation involves both hardware and digital processing:

1. **Physical Layout:**  
   Keys are arranged according to a chosen layout, most commonly QWERTY. Each key corresponds to a specific input or command.

2. **Key Switches:**  
   Under each keycap lies a switch mechanism—membrane, scissor, or mechanical—that registers a press. Mechanical switches are especially valued for their durability and tactile feedback.

3. **Keystroke Detection:**  
   Pressing a key completes an electrical circuit, generating a signal that identifies which key was pressed.

4. **Keyboard Controller:**  
   A microcontroller interprets these signals, converting them into digital data that the computer can understand.

5. **Connection to Computer:**  
   The keyboard transmits data through a USB, PS/2, or wireless (e.g., Bluetooth) connection. The computer’s operating system and applications then interpret the keystrokes.

6. **Special Keys and Functions:**  
   Modern keyboards include additional keys for navigation, editing, and media control. Some models provide programmable or macro keys for personalized functionality.

7. **Key Rollover and Ghosting:**  
   High-quality keyboards support “n-key rollover,” meaning multiple keys can be pressed simultaneously without errors. “Ghosting” occurs when unintended keystrokes are registered due to circuit limitations.

In essence, a keyboard translates physical key presses into electronic signals, processes them through a controller, and sends the resulting data to a computer. This simple yet efficient mechanism makes typing, coding, and communication possible in nearly every digital environment.
