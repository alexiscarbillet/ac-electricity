# Keyboard

A keyboard is an input device that allows users to input alphanumeric characters, symbols, and commands into a computer or other electronic device. Here's how a standard computer keyboard works:

1. **Physical Layout:** A keyboard consists of individual keys arranged in a specific layout, typically the QWERTY layout. Each key corresponds to a specific character or function.

2. **Key Switches:** Beneath each keycap is a key switch mechanism. There are different types of key switches, including membrane, scissor, and mechanical switches. Mechanical switches are often preferred by enthusiasts for their tactile feedback and durability.

3. **Keystroke Detection:** When a key is pressed, the key switch mechanism activates, registering the keystroke. This sends an electrical signal to the keyboard's controller, indicating which key has been pressed.

4. **Keyboard Controller:** The keyboard controller is a microcontroller or integrated circuit (IC) responsible for processing keystrokes and sending the corresponding signals to the computer or device. It converts the electrical signals from the key switches into digital data that the computer can understand.

5. **Connection to Computer:** The keyboard is typically connected to the computer via a wired USB or PS/2 connection, although wireless Bluetooth keyboards are also common. The keyboard sends the digital data representing keystrokes to the computer, where it is interpreted by the operating system and applications.

6. **Special Keys and Functions:** In addition to alphanumeric keys, keyboards often include special keys for functions such as navigation (arrow keys), editing (delete, backspace), and controlling media playback (play, pause, volume). Some keyboards also feature programmable keys or multimedia keys for customizable functions.

7. **Key Rollover and Ghosting:** Keyboards may support key rollover, which allows multiple keys to be pressed simultaneously and registered correctly. Ghosting occurs when certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously result in unintended keystrokes due to limitations in the keyboard's circuitry.

In summary, a keyboard works by detecting keystrokes through key switches, converting them into electrical signals, processing them with a keyboard controller, and sending the resulting data to the computer or device for interpretation. This allows users to input text, commands, and other information into their computer efficiently.
