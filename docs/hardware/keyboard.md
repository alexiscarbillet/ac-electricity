# Keyboard

## History

Keyboards have undergone significant evolution since their inception, adapting to technological advancements and changing user needs.

**Early Typewriters (19th Century)**: The precursor to modern keyboards can be traced back to the invention of the typewriter. The first commercially successful typewriter, invented by Christopher Latham Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and Samuel W. Soule, was patented in 1868. Early typewriters featured a layout similar to modern keyboards, with keys arranged in a QWERTY layout.

**Telegraph and Early Keyboards (19th Century)**: Prior to typewriters, telegraph operators used keyboards known as "telegraph keys" or "telegraph instruments" to send messages. These keyboards consisted of a set of keys for inputting Morse code signals.

**QWERTY Layout (1870s)**: The QWERTY keyboard layout, named after the first six letters on the top row of keys, was designed by Christopher Latham Sholes for the first commercially successful typewriter. The layout was intended to prevent jamming of mechanical typewriter keys by spacing out commonly used letter pairs.

**Electric Typewriters and Computer Terminals (20th Century)**: The introduction of electric typewriters in the early 20th century led to advancements in keyboard technology. Keyboards became more streamlined and included features such as adjustable key tension and improved key switches. Keyboards were also integrated into early computer terminals, which were used for data entry and communication with mainframe computers.

**Computer Keyboards (1960s-1970s)**: With the advent of personal computers in the 1960s and 1970s, keyboards became standard input devices for interacting with computers. Keyboards for early computers such as the IBM 3270 and DEC VT100 terminals featured mechanical key switches and function keys for navigating text-based interfaces.

**Membrane Keyboards (1970s-present)**: Membrane keyboards, which use a flexible membrane layer instead of individual mechanical switches, became popular in the 1970s and are still widely used today. These keyboards are often less expensive to manufacture and offer a quieter typing experience compared to mechanical keyboards.

**Mechanical Keyboards Resurgence (2010s-present)**: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in mechanical keyboards, which feature individual mechanical switches for each key. Mechanical keyboards offer tactile feedback, customizable key switches, and durability, making them popular among enthusiasts, gamers, and professionals who prefer a tactile typing experience.

**Ergonomic Keyboards and Alternative Layouts**: Alongside traditional keyboards, there has been development in ergonomic keyboards designed to reduce strain and discomfort during extended typing sessions. Alternative keyboard layouts such as Dvorak and Colemak have also been developed to improve typing speed and efficiency, although the QWERTY layout remains the most widely used.

## How it works

A keyboard is an input device that allows users to input alphanumeric characters, symbols, and commands into a computer or other electronic device. Here's how a standard computer keyboard works:

1. **Physical Layout:** A keyboard consists of individual keys arranged in a specific layout, typically the QWERTY layout. Each key corresponds to a specific character or function.

2. **Key Switches:** Beneath each keycap is a key switch mechanism. There are different types of key switches, including membrane, scissor, and mechanical switches. Mechanical switches are often preferred by enthusiasts for their tactile feedback and durability.

3. **Keystroke Detection:** When a key is pressed, the key switch mechanism activates, registering the keystroke. This sends an electrical signal to the keyboard's controller, indicating which key has been pressed.

4. **Keyboard Controller:** The keyboard controller is a microcontroller or integrated circuit (IC) responsible for processing keystrokes and sending the corresponding signals to the computer or device. It converts the electrical signals from the key switches into digital data that the computer can understand.

5. **Connection to Computer:** The keyboard is typically connected to the computer via a wired USB or PS/2 connection, although wireless Bluetooth keyboards are also common. The keyboard sends the digital data representing keystrokes to the computer, where it is interpreted by the operating system and applications.

6. **Special Keys and Functions:** In addition to alphanumeric keys, keyboards often include special keys for functions such as navigation (arrow keys), editing (delete, backspace), and controlling media playback (play, pause, volume). Some keyboards also feature programmable keys or multimedia keys for customizable functions.

7. **Key Rollover and Ghosting:** Keyboards may support key rollover, which allows multiple keys to be pressed simultaneously and registered correctly. Ghosting occurs when certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously result in unintended keystrokes due to limitations in the keyboard's circuitry.

In summary, a keyboard works by detecting keystrokes through key switches, converting them into electrical signals, processing them with a keyboard controller, and sending the resulting data to the computer or device for interpretation. This allows users to input text, commands, and other information into their computer efficiently.
