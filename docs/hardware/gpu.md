# GPU

## History

The history of **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** reflects the rapid advancement of computer graphics and the growing need for high-performance visual computation. From simple 2D accelerators to today’s AI-driven architectures, GPUs have transformed how computers render, simulate, and even think.

**Early Graphics Acceleration (1970s–1980s):**
In the earliest computers, all graphical computations were handled by the **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**. As graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and display systems became more common, it became clear that the CPU alone could not efficiently handle both logic and rendering. This led to the development of **dedicated graphics hardware**, such as IBM’s **8514/A display controller** and Texas Instruments’ **TMS34010**, often regarded as one of the first programmable graphics processors. These early accelerators laid the groundwork for offloading graphical tasks from the CPU to specialized chips.

**The Rise of 3D Graphics Accelerators (1990s):**
The 1990s marked the beginning of **dedicated 3D acceleration**. Companies like **S3 Graphics**, **3dfx Interactive**, and **ATI Technologies** (later acquired by AMD) introduced cards that could handle complex 3D rendering operations directly on the hardware. These accelerators brought smoother frame rates and better image quality to video games and CAD applications, fueling the explosion of PC gaming and multimedia graphics.

**NVIDIA and the GeForce Revolution (Late 1990s):**
Founded in 1993, **NVIDIA** revolutionized the GPU landscape. In 1999, it launched the **GeForce 256**, officially marketed as the **world’s first GPU**. It introduced **hardware transform and lighting (T&L)** — a breakthrough that enabled the GPU to handle more of the rendering workload, freeing the CPU for other tasks. This marked the start of modern GPU architecture and paved the way for programmable graphics pipelines.

**ATI Radeon and the GPU Race (Early 2000s):**
Around the same time, **ATI Technologies** introduced the **Radeon series**, competing head-to-head with NVIDIA’s GeForce lineup. Both companies continuously innovated, introducing **programmable shaders**, **high dynamic range (HDR)** rendering, and **unified shader architectures**. These advancements allowed developers to control lighting, textures, and visual effects at an unprecedented level of realism.

**General-Purpose Computing on GPUs (Mid-2000s):**
By the mid-2000s, GPUs had evolved from graphics-only processors into powerful parallel computing devices. With the introduction of **NVIDIA’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)** in 2006 and **AMD’s Stream/APP SDK**, developers gained access to the GPU’s raw computational power for non-graphical tasks. This movement, known as **GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on GPUs)**, enabled GPUs to accelerate workloads such as fluid dynamics, data mining, cryptography, and later, **machine learning**.

**Modern GPU Architectures (2010s–Present):**
The 2010s saw the emergence of new architectures such as NVIDIA’s **Turing**, **Ampere**, and **Ada Lovelace**, and AMD’s **RDNA** and **CDNA** lines. These architectures emphasized not only gaming performance but also **energy efficiency**, **AI acceleration**, and **real-time ray tracing**. NVIDIA’s **RTX** series introduced **Tensor Cores** for deep learning and **RT Cores** for real-time ray tracing, while AMD’s Radeon RX and Instinct series pushed open standards and competitive performance.

**Integration into Cloud and Data Centers (2010s–Present):**
GPUs are now a cornerstone of **data center and cloud computing infrastructure**. They power AI model training, high-performance computing (HPC), and real-time analytics. NVIDIA’s **Tesla** and **A100** GPUs and AMD’s **Radeon Instinct** accelerators are optimized for massive parallelism and floating-point performance, enabling breakthroughs in fields like natural language processing, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.

## How It Works

A **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** is a specialized electronic circuit engineered to handle highly parallel workloads — particularly the rapid manipulation of memory to produce images for display. However, its architecture also makes it suitable for a wide variety of computational tasks beyond graphics.

1. **Parallel Processing Architecture:**
   Unlike CPUs, which have a few powerful cores optimized for sequential tasks, GPUs contain **hundreds or thousands of smaller cores** designed for **massive parallelism**. Each core can handle small portions of data simultaneously, making GPUs ideal for rendering millions of pixels or performing matrix operations in AI and scientific computing.

2. **The Graphics Pipeline:**
   Rendering an image involves a sequence of processing stages collectively known as the **graphics pipeline**. This includes:

   * **Geometry Processing:** Converting 3D models into mathematical representations.
   * **Vertex Shading:** Adjusting the position, color, and lighting of vertices.
   * **Rasterization:** Transforming 3D geometry into 2D pixels.
   * **Fragment (Pixel) Shading:** Applying textures, lighting, and effects to determine the color of each pixel.
   * **Output Merging:** Combining all rendered elements into the final image displayed on screen.

3. **Vertex and Fragment Shaders:**
   Shaders are small programs executed on the GPU.

   * **Vertex shaders** handle transformations of 3D coordinates and lighting effects.
   * **Fragment shaders** determine the final appearance of each pixel, considering light, texture, and transparency.
     Modern GPUs also support **geometry**, **compute**, and **tessellation shaders**, providing more flexibility for developers.

4. **Memory and Bandwidth (VRAM):**
   GPUs use high-speed dedicated memory known as **VRAM (Video RAM)** to store data such as textures, frame buffers, and intermediate results. The bandwidth and capacity of VRAM directly affect rendering performance and resolution capabilities.

5. **Rendering Techniques:**
   GPUs implement advanced rendering methods, including:

   * **Rasterization:** The traditional and fast approach used in real-time rendering.
   * **Ray Tracing:** A more computationally intensive method that simulates light paths to create photorealistic reflections and shadows.
   * **AI-Assisted Rendering:** Using neural networks to upscale images or denoise ray-traced scenes for better performance and quality.

6. **API and Software Interfaces:**
   GPUs communicate with applications through **graphics APIs** such as **DirectX**, **OpenGL**, **Vulkan**, and **Metal**. These APIs abstract complex hardware operations, allowing developers to create cross-platform graphics and compute applications efficiently. For general-purpose computing, frameworks like **CUDA** and **OpenCL** expose the GPU’s computational capabilities beyond rendering.

### Beyond Graphics

Modern GPUs are no longer limited to displaying visuals. They now play a crucial role in **artificial intelligence**, **cryptocurrency mining**, **autonomous systems**, and **scientific simulations**. Their ability to process vast amounts of data in parallel makes them indispensable for the world’s most demanding computational challenges.

As GPU technology continues to evolve, it blurs the line between **graphics processing** and **general computing**, driving innovation across industries — from entertainment and design to research and cloud computing.
