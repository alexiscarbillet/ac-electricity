## History

The history of the refrigerator is a fascinating journey spanning centuries of innovation and technological advancements. Here are the main facts:

**Early Refrigeration Methods**: The concept of refrigeration dates back to ancient times when people used various methods to preserve food, such as storing it in cool caves, using ice or snow, or using evaporation techniques.

**First Artificial Refrigeration**: The modern history of refrigeration began in the early 18th century. In 1748, William Cullen, a Scottish scientist, demonstrated the first artificial refrigeration by evaporating ethyl ether in a partial vacuum. However, this was a scientific experiment and not a practical application.

**Refrigeration for Commercial Use**: In the 19th century, commercial refrigeration began to emerge. In 1805, Oliver Evans, an American inventor, designed the first refrigeration machine, but it was not widely adopted.

**Ice Harvesting Industry**: Before mechanical refrigeration became common, ice harvesting was a significant industry. Ice was cut from lakes and rivers during the winter months and stored in icehouses for later use.

**The Icebox**: In the mid-19th century, the icebox became a common household appliance. It consisted of a wooden or metal box insulated with materials like sawdust or cork, with a compartment for ice at the top and a storage area for food below.

**Mechanical Refrigeration**: The breakthrough in mechanical refrigeration came in the late 19th century. Carl von Linde, a German engineer, developed the first practical refrigeration machine in 1876, using ammonia as a refrigerant.

**Domestic Refrigerators**: The first domestic refrigerators began to appear in the early 20th century. These early models often used toxic or flammable refrigerants and were expensive, limiting their widespread adoption.

**Freon and Modern Refrigerants**: In the 1920s, Thomas Midgley Jr. developed Freon, a non-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant, which revolutionized the industry. Freon was widely used in refrigerators until the late 20th century when it was phased out due to its harmful effects on the ozone layer.

**Advancements in Design and Efficiency**: Over the decades, refrigerators have undergone significant advancements in design, efficiency, and features. These include the introduction of automatic defrosting, adjustable temperature controls, and energy-saving technologies.

**Smart Refrigerators**: In recent years, smart refrigerators equipped with advanced features like touchscreen displays, internet connectivity, and built-in cameras have become increasingly popular.

## How it works

1. **Compressor**: The compressor is the heart of the refrigeration system. It is an electrically powered pump that circulates refrigerant throughout the system. When the refrigerator is turned on, the compressor compresses the refrigerant gas, increasing its pressure and temperature.

2. **Condenser Coil**: The high-pressure, high-temperature refrigerant gas then flows into the condenser coil, usually located at the back or bottom of the refrigerator. Here, the gas releases heat to the surrounding environment, causing it to condense into a high-pressure liquid.

3. **Expansion Valve**: The high-pressure liquid refrigerant then passes through an expansion valve, which reduces its pressure and temperature as it enters the evaporator coil.

4. **Evaporator Coil**: Inside the refrigerator, the low-pressure, low-temperature liquid refrigerant flows through the evaporator coil. As it absorbs heat from the interior of the refrigerator, it evaporates into a low-pressure gas.

5. **Fan**: A fan blows air over the evaporator coil, helping to transfer heat from the refrigerator's interior to the evaporating refrigerant.

6. **Thermostat**: The thermostat monitors the temperature inside the refrigerator. When the temperature rises above the desired set point, the thermostat signals the compressor to turn on and start the refrigeration cycle again.

7. **Defrost Heater (in some models)**: In refrigerators with automatic defrost systems, a defrost heater is used to melt frost and ice buildup on the evaporator coil. This heater is typically activated periodically to prevent excessive ice buildup, which can decrease the refrigerator's efficiency.

8. **Control Circuit**: The control circuit manages the operation of various components in the refrigerator, including the compressor, fan, and defrost heater. It receives input from the thermostat and other sensors to regulate temperature and ensure efficient operation.

In summary, the electrical operation of a refrigerator involves the compressor pumping refrigerant through a closed-loop system, where it undergoes changes in pressure and temperature to absorb heat from the interior of the refrigerator and release it to the surrounding environment. This continuous cycle of compression, condensation, expansion, and evaporation maintains a cool temperature inside the refrigerator to preserve food.
