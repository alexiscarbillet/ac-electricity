# Stove

An electric stove, also known as an electric range or cooker, operates by using electricity to generate heat for cooking. Here's how it works :

1. **Power Supply**: The electric stove is connected to a power source, typically a standard electrical outlet in a household.

2. **Control Panel**: The stove is equipped with a control panel that allows the user to select the desired cooking temperature or power level for each cooking element (burner).

3. **Cooking Elements (Burners)**: Each burner on the electric stove contains a coiled heating element made of a resistive material such as nichrome wire. When electricity flows through these heating elements, they generate heat due to their resistance to the flow of electrical current.

4. **Switches and Controls**: When the user turns on a burner using the control panel, it activates a switch that completes the electrical circuit, allowing electricity to flow through the heating element. The user can adjust the heat output by varying the temperature or power level using the control panel.

5. **Thermal Regulation**: Some electric stoves are equipped with temperature sensors or thermostats that monitor the temperature of the cooking surface. These sensors help regulate the heat output to maintain the desired cooking temperature.

6. **Cookware**: The cooking surface of the electric stove heats up, transferring heat to the cookware placed on top of the burners. The heat generated by the heating elements is conducted through the cookware to cook food.

7. **Safety Features**: Modern electric stoves often include safety features such as automatic shut-off mechanisms to prevent overheating or electrical hazards.

8. **Indicator Lights**: Many electric stoves have indicator lights that illuminate when a burner is in use, helping users to know which burners are active.

Overall, an electric stove works by converting electrical energy into heat energy using resistive heating elements, providing a controlled and efficient means of cooking various types of food.
