# Stove

## History

The stove has evolved over thousands of years, reflecting advancements in technology and human cooking practices.

**Ancient Stoves**  
Early societies used simple hearths or fire pits made from clay, stone, or brick. These primitive stoves provided a controlled space for open-flame cooking, forming the foundation of later stove designs.

**Roman Hypocaust**  
The Romans created the hypocaust, an advanced heating system featuring raised floors and channels that circulated hot air and smoke from a furnace. This innovation improved heating efficiency and allowed for more controlled cooking than traditional open fires.

**Medieval Stoves**  
During the Middle Ages, enclosed stoves with chimneys became common in castles, monasteries, and wealthy homes. These brick or metal stoves enabled better combustion and temperature control while keeping smoke out of living spaces.

**Franklin Stove (18th Century)**  
Benjamin Franklin introduced the Franklin stove, a cast-iron heating appliance designed to improve fireplace efficiency. Its vented design radiated more heat into a room and inspired later stove innovations.

**Industrial Revolution (18th–19th Century)**  
Cast iron stoves emerged as durable, efficient, and versatile cooking appliances. Fueled by wood, coal, and eventually gas, these stoves spread widely across Europe and North America.

**Gas Stoves (19th Century)**  
The invention of the gas stove offered cleaner, more controllable cooking with adjustable flames. Gas stoves became popular in areas with access to piped natural gas or propane.

**Electric Stoves (Late 19th–20th Century)**  
Electric stoves introduced resistive heating elements in coils or plates. They offered smoke-free, easy-to-control cooking but initially faced adoption challenges due to limited electrical infrastructure.

**Modern Stove Designs**  
Today’s stoves include gas, electric, and induction models, often paired with ovens. Modern features include convection systems, self-cleaning modes, digital touch controls, and improved safety features. Innovations continue to enhance convenience, energy efficiency, and cooking precision.

## How It Works

An electric stove (electric range or cooker) heats food by converting electrical energy into thermal energy using resistive heating elements.

1. **Power Supply**  
   The stove connects to a dedicated household electrical circuit, supplying the power needed for high-temperature cooking.

2. **Control Panel**  
   User controls—knobs, switches, or touch panels—allow adjustment of cooking temperatures or power levels for each burner.

3. **Cooking Elements (Burners)**  
   Each burner contains a coiled resistive heating element, typically made of nichrome. When electricity flows through the coil, it generates heat due to electrical resistance.

4. **Switches and Controls**  
   Activating a burner completes the electrical circuit, allowing current to flow through the heating element. Heat output increases or decreases based on the selected power level.

5. **Thermal Regulation**  
   Many stoves include thermostats or temperature sensors that help maintain consistent heat on the cooking surface.

6. **Cookware Interaction**  
   The burner heats the cookware placed on top, transferring heat through conduction to cook the food.

7. **Safety Features**  
   Modern stoves often include automatic shut-off mechanisms, surface temperature sensors, and overheat protection.

8. **Indicator Lights**  
   Visual indicators show which burners are active or still hot, improving user safety.

Electric stoves provide a controlled, smoke-free, and reliable method for cooking a wide variety of foods.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Clean operation** — no flames, smoke, or soot. | **Slower heating** compared to gas or induction stoves. |
| **Even, consistent heat** — good for simmering and baking. | **Higher energy consumption** relative to gas in some regions. |
| **Easy to use** — simple controls and predictable temperature settings. | **Heat retention** — burners stay hot long after being turned off. |
| **Wide availability** — compatible with most household electrical setups. | **Less precise temperature control** compared to gas. |
| **Safer surface** — fewer fire risks without open flames. | **Not suitable for all cookware** — some materials work less effectively. |
| **Low maintenance** — few moving parts and easy cleaning. | |
