# Air conditioner

## History

The history of air conditioning is a fascinating journey that spans centuries of innovation and technological advancement. Here's a brief overview:

**Early Concepts**: The concept of cooling indoor spaces dates back to ancient civilizations. For example, ancient Egyptians used reed mats soaked in water to cool the air blowing into their homes. Similarly, ancient Romans circulated aqueduct water through the walls of wealthy homes to cool them.

**18th and 19th Centuries**: In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley experimented with the cooling effects of evaporation. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that significant developments occurred. In 1820, British inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when it evaporated. This laid the groundwork for modern refrigeration technology.

**Early 20th Century**: The early 20th century saw several milestones in air conditioning development. In 1902, Willis Haviland Carrier invented the first modern electrical air conditioning unit. Carrier's invention was primarily designed to control humidity in a printing plant, but it also had a cooling effect. This invention led to the founding of Carrier Corporation, a major player in the HVAC industry.

**Advancements**: Throughout the 20th century, air conditioning technology evolved rapidly. Improvements in compressor design, refrigerants, and insulation materials made air conditioning units more efficient, affordable, and compact. Central air conditioning systems became common in large buildings and homes, revolutionizing living and working environments, particularly in hot and humid climates.

**Residential Air Conditioning**: Initially, air conditioning was primarily used in commercial and industrial settings. However, after World War II, residential air conditioning became increasingly popular in the United States. The widespread adoption of residential air conditioning systems dramatically changed housing designs, population distribution, and lifestyle patterns, leading to the development of suburban communities and the Sun Belt region.

**Environmental Concerns**: In the latter half of the 20th century, concerns grew about the environmental impact of air conditioning, particularly regarding the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerants. CFCs were found to deplete the ozone layer, leading to the adoption of more environmentally friendly refrigerants, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

**Recent Developments**: In recent years, advancements in air conditioning technology have focused on improving energy efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and integrating smart features for better control and automation. Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems, ductless mini-split systems, and heat pump technology are some of the innovations that have gained popularity for their energy-saving benefits and flexibility.

## How it works

An air conditioner works by using a process called refrigeration to remove heat from an indoor space and transfer it outside, thereby cooling the indoor air. From an electrical point of view, here's how it generally works:

1. **Power Supply**: The air conditioner is connected to an electrical power source, typically a standard household electrical outlet.

2. **Thermostat Control**: The user sets the desired temperature using the thermostat. When the indoor temperature rises above this set point, the thermostat signals the air conditioner to start cooling.

3. **Compressor**: The heart of the air conditioning system is the compressor, which is typically powered by an electric motor. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant, a special fluid with a low boiling point.

4. **Condenser Coil**: The high-pressure, high-temperature refrigerant gas leaving the compressor flows into the condenser coil, usually located outside the building. As the hot refrigerant gas travels through the condenser coil, it releases heat to the outdoor air and condenses into a liquid.

5. **Expansion Valve**: The liquid refrigerant then passes through an expansion valve, which causes it to rapidly expand and reduce in pressure. This process also causes the refrigerant to cool significantly.

6. **Evaporator Coil**: The now cold refrigerant flows into the evaporator coil, located inside the building. As warm indoor air is blown over the evaporator coil by the blower fan, the cold refrigerant absorbs heat from the indoor air, cooling it in the process.

7. **Blower Fan**: The blower fan circulates indoor air over the evaporator coil, where it is cooled, and then distributes the cooled air back into the living space through ducts or vents.

8. **Refrigerant Cycle**: The refrigerant, now warmed up by absorbing heat from the indoor air, returns to the compressor to repeat the cycle.

Overall, the electrical components in an air conditioner work together to power the compressor and blower fan, as well as control various functions such as temperature regulation and fan speed, ultimately allowing the system to efficiently cool indoor spaces.
