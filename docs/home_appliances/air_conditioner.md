# ❄️ Air Conditioner

## History

The history of air conditioning is a fascinating journey that spans centuries of innovation and technological advancement. Here's a brief overview:

**Early Concepts**: The concept of cooling indoor spaces dates back to ancient civilizations. For example, ancient Egyptians used reed mats soaked in water to cool the air blowing into their homes. Similarly, ancient Romans circulated aqueduct water through the walls of wealthy homes to cool them. The principle here was primarily **evaporative cooling** or using ambient environmental resources.

**18th and 19th Centuries**: In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley experimented with the cooling effects of evaporation using alcohol. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that significant developments occurred in **mechanical refrigeration**. In **1820**, British inventor **Michael Faraday** discovered that compressing and liquefying **ammonia** could chill air when it evaporated, laying the groundwork for the modern vapor-compression cycle. In **1842**, American physician **Dr. John Gorrie** built a machine that used compressed air to make ice, attempting to cool hospital rooms, which was a clear predecessor to modern comfort cooling.

**Early 20th Century**: The early 20th century saw several milestones in air conditioning development. In **1902**, **Willis Haviland Carrier** invented the first modern electrical air conditioning unit for a Brooklyn printing plant. Carrier's system was engineered to control **humidity** first, by maintaining a constant $55\%$ relative humidity, which simultaneously controlled temperature. This precise humidity control (dehumidification) was revolutionary. This invention led to the founding of **Carrier Corporation**, a major player in the HVAC industry.

**Advancements in Refrigerants and Components**: Throughout the 20th century, air conditioning technology evolved rapidly. Early systems often used toxic or flammable refrigerants like ammonia or methyl chloride. The introduction of the first generation of safe, synthetic refrigerants, particularly **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)** like Freon-12, in the 1930s made residential air conditioning viable. Improvements in **hermetic compressor** design, where the motor and compressor are sealed together, increased efficiency and compactness. **Central air conditioning systems** became common in large buildings and homes, revolutionizing living and working environments, particularly in hot and humid climates.

**Residential Air Conditioning**: Initially, air conditioning was primarily used in commercial and industrial settings (textile mills, printing plants). However, after World War II, the mass production of **window units** and subsequent wide adoption of **residential air conditioning systems** in the United States dramatically changed housing designs, population distribution, and lifestyle patterns, leading to the development of suburban communities and the growth of the Sun Belt region.

**Environmental Concerns**: In the latter half of the 20th century, concerns grew about the environmental impact of air conditioning, particularly regarding the use of CFCs. They were found to deplete the stratospheric **ozone layer**, leading to the **Montreal Protocol (1987)** which mandated the phase-out of CFCs and later, transitional **HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons)**. This forced the industry to adopt less harmful alternatives, such as **HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons)** and current-generation refrigerants.

**Recent Developments**: In recent years, advancements have focused heavily on **energy efficiency** and digital control. Innovations include **Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF)** systems, which allow a single outdoor unit to connect to multiple indoor units with individualized control, and the widespread adoption of **Inverter Technology**. Inverter systems use a **variable speed compressor motor** (driven by a Variable Frequency Drive, VFD) to precisely match the cooling load, leading to significant energy savings and improved comfort over traditional single-speed compressors. **Ductless mini-split systems** have also gained popularity for their flexibility and efficiency in zone cooling.

## How it works

An air conditioner works by using a process called **vapor-compression refrigeration** to remove heat from an indoor space and transfer it outside. From an electrical and electro-mechanical point of view, the system operation relies on the controlled sequencing and powering of high-load components.

### 1. Electrical Power and Control Logic

* **Power Supply**: AC systems use two main voltage levels: high voltage ($\mathbf{120\ V}$ or $\mathbf{240\ V}$) for the mechanical work, and low voltage ($\mathbf{24\ V}$) for the control logic.
* **Thermostat**: The thermostat contains temperature sensors and logic that compares the current room temperature to the user's **set point**. When cooling is needed, the thermostat sends a low-voltage signal to the main control board.
* **Control Board and Contactors**: The $24\ \text{V}$ signal energizes **contactors** (heavy-duty electromagnetic relays) located in the outdoor unit. These contactors act as high-current switches, bridging the gap to supply the main high-voltage power directly to the compressor and the condenser fan motor.

### 2. High-Load Components and Motor Operation

The system's three major power loads are **induction motors**:

* **Compressor Motor (The Heart)**: This is the largest power consumer. It is an **hermetically sealed induction motor** that drives the compressor pump. Traditional units use single-speed motors, requiring **start and run capacitors** to provide the necessary phase shift to generate high starting torque and maintain efficient rotation. In **inverter units**, the AC supply is rectified to DC, and then converted back to variable-frequency AC by an inverter circuit to drive a variable-speed motor, allowing precise output control.
* **Condenser Fan Motor**: Located in the outdoor unit, this motor spins the fan blade, forcing air across the hot **condenser coil** to facilitate heat rejection.
* **Blower Fan Motor**: Located in the indoor unit, this motor draws warm air from the room, forces it across the cold **evaporator coil**, and distributes the cooled air through the ductwork or back into the room.

### 3. The Refrigeration Cycle (Thermal Process)

The electrical system powers the process that moves heat (thermal energy) using the refrigerant:

1.  **Compression (Work Input):** The electrically-driven compressor raises the pressure of the low-pressure, low-temperature refrigerant gas, simultaneously raising its temperature far above the ambient outdoor temperature.
2.  **Condensation (Heat Rejection):** The hot, high-pressure gas flows through the outdoor condenser coil. Heat flows naturally from the hotter refrigerant to the cooler outdoor air, causing the refrigerant to cool and **condense** into a high-pressure liquid.
3.  **Expansion (Pressure Drop):** The high-pressure liquid passes through a **metering device** (like a thermal expansion valve or capillary tube), which causes a rapid pressure drop. This sudden decrease in pressure forces the refrigerant temperature to drop dramatically, making it colder than the indoor air.
4.  **Evaporation (Heat Absorption):** The cold, low-pressure liquid flows through the indoor **evaporator coil**. Warm indoor air blows over this coil, and heat flows naturally from the warmer indoor air into the colder refrigerant, causing the refrigerant to **evaporate** (boil) back into a low-pressure gas, completing the cooling cycle and returning to the compressor.
