# Freezer

## History

The history of the freezer, as a household appliance for preserving food, is an interesting journey that spans several centuries. Here's an overview:

**Natural Ice Harvesting (Pre-19th Century)**: Before the invention of mechanical freezers, people relied on natural ice for food preservation. In colder regions, ice was harvested from frozen lakes and ponds during the winter months and stored in insulated ice houses or iceboxes for use throughout the year.

**Early Refrigeration Techniques (19th Century)**: In the 19th century, various techniques were developed for artificial refrigeration. One notable early method was the use of iceboxes, insulated containers filled with ice to keep food cool. Iceboxes were common household appliances until the widespread adoption of mechanical refrigeration.

**Invention of Mechanical Refrigeration (Mid-19th Century)**: The invention of mechanical refrigeration systems laid the groundwork for modern freezers. In 1851, American physician John Gorrie invented a mechanical refrigeration system for cooling hospital rooms and preserving food. His system used compressed air to cool water, which was then used to lower the temperature in the rooms.

**Commercial Refrigeration (Late 19th Century)**: Mechanical refrigeration systems were initially used in commercial and industrial settings, such as meatpacking plants and breweries, before becoming available for home use. The introduction of mechanical refrigerators and freezers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revolutionized food storage and distribution.

**Introduction of Home Refrigerators and Freezers (Early 20th Century)**: The first commercially successful home refrigerators and freezers were introduced in the early 20th century. These early appliances were typically large, bulky units that required manual defrosting and maintenance. They relied on compression refrigeration systems to keep food cold.

**Development of Automatic Defrosting (Mid-20th Century)**: In the mid-20th century, automatic defrosting became a standard feature in many home freezers. This innovation eliminated the need for manual defrosting, making freezers more convenient and easier to maintain for consumers.

**Advancements in Energy Efficiency and Design (Late 20th Century - Present)**: In recent decades, there have been significant advancements in freezer technology, including improvements in energy efficiency, temperature control, and storage capacity. Modern freezers come in a variety of styles and configurations, including upright freezers, chest freezers, and refrigerator-freezer combinations, to suit different household needs.

**Smart and Connected Freezers (21st Century)**: With the advent of smart home technology, some freezers now feature connectivity and smart controls. These smart freezers can be monitored and controlled remotely via smartphone apps, allowing users to check the temperature, adjust settings, and receive alerts about power outages or temperature fluctuations.

## How it works

A freezer operates on the principle of heat transfer, using electricity to create and maintain a cold environment inside the freezer compartment. Here's how it works:

1. **Compressor**: The heart of a freezer's refrigeration system is the compressor. The compressor is an electrically powered pump that circulates refrigerant (a special fluid with low boiling and condensing temperatures) throughout the system. It is typically powered by the electricity supplied from an outlet.

2. **Evaporator**: Inside the freezer compartment, there is an evaporator coil. This coil is filled with the refrigerant pumped by the compressor. As the refrigerant flows through the evaporator coil, it absorbs heat from the air inside the freezer, causing the air to cool down.

3. **Expansion Valve**: After absorbing heat from the freezer air, the refrigerant in its gaseous state is then passed through an expansion valve. The expansion valve regulates the flow of refrigerant into the evaporator coil, controlling the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant as it enters the coil.

4. **Heat Release**: As the refrigerant flows through the evaporator coil and absorbs heat from the freezer air, it evaporates into a gas. This gas is then pumped by the compressor into the condenser coils located outside the freezer.

5. **Condenser Coils**: The condenser coils are located either on the back or underneath the freezer unit. The refrigerant, now in its gaseous state, releases the heat it absorbed from the freezer air into the surrounding environment as it passes through the condenser coils. This causes the refrigerant to condense back into a liquid state.

6. **Expansion**: The liquid refrigerant, having released its heat, passes through the expansion valve again, where it undergoes a pressure drop. This causes the refrigerant to expand and cool down, preparing it to absorb more heat in the evaporator coil and repeat the cycle.

7. **Temperature Regulation**: The freezer's temperature is controlled by a thermostat, which senses the temperature inside the freezer compartment. When the temperature rises above the desired set point, the thermostat activates the compressor to start the refrigeration cycle and cool down the freezer again.

Overall, a freezer operates by using electricity to power a refrigeration system that circulates refrigerant, absorbing heat from inside the freezer and releasing it outside, thus maintaining a cold temperature inside the freezer compartment.
