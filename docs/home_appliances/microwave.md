# Microwave

## History

The microwave oven has become an essential household appliance, known for its ability to heat and cook food rapidly and conveniently.

**Discovery of Microwave Technology**  
In 1945, engineer Percy Spencer of Raytheon Corporation accidentally discovered the heating effect of microwaves while working on radar equipment. A candy bar in his pocket melted when he stood near an active magnetron—a vacuum tube used in radar systems—revealing microwaves’ ability to heat food.

**Invention of the Microwave Oven**  
Following this discovery, Raytheon filed a patent for the first microwave cooking oven in 1945. The first prototype, named the *Radarange*, stood nearly 6 feet tall, weighed more than 750 pounds, and was extremely expensive. It was intended mainly for restaurants, ships, and industrial kitchens.

**Early Home Microwave Ovens**  
In 1955, Raytheon launched the first microwave oven designed for home use, also called the *Radarrange*. Despite being smaller than the original prototype, it remained bulky (over 300 pounds) and prohibitively expensive—approximately \$1,200 at the time (over \$11,000 today).

**Popularity and Miniaturization**  
During the 1960s and 1970s, technological advancements dramatically reduced the size and cost of microwave ovens. As mass production increased and components became more affordable, microwaves entered mainstream households across the world.

**Feature Evolution**  
Modern microwave ovens include numerous features such as adjustable power levels, preset cooking and defrost cycles, convection modes, grill combinations, child-safety locks, and automatic shut-off sensors.

**Impact on Food Culture**  
Microwave ovens changed how people cook, making reheating and meal preparation faster and more energy-efficient. While the convenience is widely appreciated, debates persist about food texture and nutritional retention compared to traditional cooking methods.

**Continued Innovation**  
Today’s microwave ovens integrate smart technology, including Wi-Fi controls, voice assistants, sensor cooking, and compatibility with smart home ecosystems. Research continues into improving energy efficiency, cooking precision, and material safety.

## How It Works

A microwave oven heats food by converting electrical energy into microwave radiation, which excites water molecules inside the food.

1. **Power Source**  
   The appliance draws AC power from a standard outlet (typically 120 V in the U.S.).

2. **High-Voltage System**  
   A transformer boosts the input voltage to 2,000–5,000 volts—necessary to power the magnetron.

3. **Magnetron**  
   The magnetron uses this high voltage to generate a strong magnetic field, causing electrons to oscillate within its cavities.

4. **Microwave Generation**  
   These oscillating electrons produce microwave radiation, which is channeled through a waveguide into the cooking chamber.

5. **Food Heating**  
   Microwaves cause water molecules in food to vibrate rapidly, generating heat through molecular friction. This heat spreads throughout the food, warming it quickly.

6. **Safety Features**  
   Interlock switches prevent operation when the door is open, and the door’s metal mesh blocks microwaves from escaping.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Fast heating** — drastically reduces cooking and reheating time. | **Uneven heating** — some foods may heat inconsistently without stirring or turning. |
| **Energy efficient** — uses less energy than conventional ovens for small portions. | **Limited browning/crisping** — cannot easily brown or crisp foods without convection or grill features. |
| **Convenient and easy to use** — simple controls and preset programs. | **Texture differences** — certain foods may become soggy or rubbery. |
| **Safe to operate** — built-in interlocks and shielding prevent microwave leakage. | **Size limitations** — cavity size restricts the dimensions of dishes or large items. |
| **Low maintenance** — minimal cleaning and few moving parts. | **Possible nutrient loss** — though comparable to other methods, some users worry about nutrient retention. |
| **Versatile** — reheating, defrosting, cooking, steaming, and more with modern models. | **Reliance on microwave-safe containers** — some materials cannot be used. |
