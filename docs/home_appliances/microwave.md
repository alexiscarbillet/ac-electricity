# Microwave

## History

The microwave oven, often simply referred to as a microwave, has become a ubiquitous kitchen appliance for heating and cooking food quickly and efficiently.

**Discovery of Microwave Technology**: The foundation for microwave cooking was laid with the discovery of microwave technology in the early 20th century. In 1945, Percy Spencer, an American engineer working for Raytheon Corporation, discovered the heating effect of microwaves while working on radar equipment during World War II. He noticed that a candy bar in his pocket melted when he stood near a magnetron, a type of vacuum tube used in radar systems.

**Invention of the Microwave Oven**: Building on Percy Spencer's discovery, Raytheon filed a patent for the first microwave cooking oven in 1945. The prototype microwave oven, known as the Radarange, was large, heavy, and expensive, standing nearly 6 feet tall and weighing over 750 pounds. It was primarily intended for commercial and industrial use, such as in restaurants and ships.

**Introduction of Home Microwave Ovens**: In 1955, Raytheon introduced the first commercially available microwave oven for home use, the Raytheon Radarrange. Priced at around $1,200 (equivalent to over $11,000 in today's money) and weighing over 300 pounds, it was still too expensive and cumbersome for widespread adoption in households.

**Popularity and Miniaturization**: Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, advancements in technology and manufacturing processes led to the miniaturization and mass production of microwave ovens. As production costs decreased and consumer demand increased, microwave ovens became more affordable and compact, making them accessible to a broader audience.

**Microwave Oven Features**: Over the years, microwave ovens have evolved to incorporate various features and capabilities, including different power levels, preset cooking programs, defrosting functions, convection cooking, and combination microwave-oven-grill units. Modern microwave ovens also come with safety features such as child locks and automatic shut-off mechanisms.

**Impact on Cooking and Food Culture**: The widespread adoption of microwave ovens has had a significant impact on cooking practices and food culture. Microwave cooking offers convenience, speed, and energy efficiency, allowing people to prepare meals quickly and easily. However, there has been ongoing debate about the nutritional value and taste of microwave-cooked food compared to traditional cooking methods.

**Continued Innovation**: In recent years, manufacturers have continued to innovate and improve microwave oven technology. Advancements include smart features, such as Wi-Fi connectivity and voice control, as well as integration with other kitchen appliances in smart home ecosystems. There is also ongoing research into new materials and technologies to enhance cooking performance and energy efficiency.

## How it works

A microwave oven works by converting electrical energy into microwave radiation, which is then used to heat food. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Power Source**: The microwave oven is connected to a standard electrical outlet, typically providing AC (alternating current) power at a voltage suitable for the appliance (usually around 120 volts in the United States).

2. **Magnetron**: Inside the microwave oven, there's a component called the magnetron, which is essentially an electron tube that generates microwave radiation. It's powered by the electrical energy supplied from the outlet.

3. **High Voltage Circuit**: The electrical energy from the power source is directed through a high voltage transformer, which steps up the voltage to a much higher level, typically in the range of 2000 to 5000 volts. This high voltage is necessary to power the magnetron.

4. **Magnetron Operation**: The high voltage is supplied to the magnetron, where it creates a strong magnetic field. This magnetic field causes electrons to move in a specific pattern within the magnetron's vacuum chamber.

5. **Microwave Generation**: As the electrons move within the magnetron, they interact with a resonant cavity, causing them to emit microwave radiation. The microwaves are then directed into the cooking chamber via a waveguide.

6. **Food Heating**: When microwaves enter the cooking chamber, they interact with the water molecules present in the food. The microwaves cause the water molecules to oscillate rapidly, generating heat through friction. This heat is then conducted throughout the food, heating it quickly and evenly.

7. **Safety Features**: Microwave ovens are equipped with safety features such as interlock switches and a metal mesh screen on the door to prevent microwave radiation from escaping the cooking chamber and harming users.

Overall, a microwave oven converts electrical energy into microwave radiation, which is then used to heat food efficiently and quickly.
