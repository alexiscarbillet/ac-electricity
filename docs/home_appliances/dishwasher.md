# Dishwasher

## History

The history of the dishwasher is a fascinating journey that spans centuries. Here are some main facts about its evolution:

**Early Concepts**: The idea of a mechanical device to clean dishes dates back to the 17th century. In 1850, Joel Houghton patented the first dishwasher-like device, but it was not very practical.

**Josephine Cochrane**: In the late 19th century, Josephine Cochrane, an American socialite, invented the first practical dishwasher. She was motivated by the desire to protect her fine china during washing. Her dishwasher, patented in 1886, used water pressure to clean dishes in a wire rack.

**Commercialization**: Cochrane's invention was initially targeted at hotels and restaurants, where it found success due to its efficiency. It wasn't until later that dishwashers became popular household appliances.

**Early Household Adoption**: In the early 20th century, dishwashers were still primarily commercial appliances due to their large size and expense. However, by the 1950s, smaller, more affordable models were developed for home use.

**Technological Advancements**: Over the years, dishwashers have seen numerous technological advancements, including the addition of heating elements for drying, different wash cycles, and energy-efficient designs.

**Modern Features**: In recent decades, dishwashers have become increasingly sophisticated, with features such as adjustable racks, soil sensors, and specialized wash cycles for delicate items or heavy-duty cleaning.

**Energy Efficiency**: With growing concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact, manufacturers have focused on improving the energy efficiency of dishwashers. Many modern models are designed to use less water and electricity than their predecessors.

**Integration with Smart Home Technology**: In the 21st century, many dishwashers have been integrated into smart home systems, allowing users to control them remotely via smartphones or voice commands.

## How it works

1. **Power Supply**: A dishwasher is typically connected to a power source, usually a standard electrical outlet. The voltage requirement may vary depending on the model, but it's usually around 120 volts for residential dishwashers.

2. **Control Panel**: The control panel is where the user selects the desired wash cycle, temperature settings, and other options. It contains electronic controls and display screens to provide feedback to the user.

3. **Water Inlet Valve**: When the dishwasher is started, a solenoid-operated water inlet valve opens to allow water from the household supply to enter the dishwasher. This valve is controlled by the electronic control panel.

4. **Heating Element**: Most dishwashers have a heating element located at the bottom of the tub. This element heats the water to the desired temperature for effective cleaning. It's usually controlled by a thermostat to maintain the set temperature.

5. **Wash Pump**: The wash pump is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It's typically an electric motor connected to an impeller or propeller that creates water pressure to spray water onto the dishes.

6. **Detergent Dispenser**: The detergent dispenser releases detergent at the appropriate time during the wash cycle. It may be a simple mechanical mechanism or controlled electronically by the dishwasher's control panel.

7. **Spray Arms**: Inside the dishwasher, there are one or more spray arms that rotate and distribute water throughout the tub. These arms are usually connected to the wash pump and powered by it.

8. **Drain Pump**: After the wash cycle is complete, the drain pump activates to remove dirty water from the dishwasher. The pump is usually located at the bottom of the tub and is activated by the control panel.

9. **Rinse Aid Dispenser**: Some dishwashers have a rinse aid dispenser that releases rinse aid during the rinse cycle to improve drying and prevent water spots on dishes. This dispenser may also be electronically controlled.

10. **Dry Cycle**: During the drying cycle, the heating element may continue to operate to evaporate any remaining moisture from the dishes. Some dishwashers also use a fan to aid in drying.

Overall, a dishwasher relies on a combination of electrical components, including motors, solenoids, heating elements, and electronic controls, to automate the process of cleaning dishes efficiently.
