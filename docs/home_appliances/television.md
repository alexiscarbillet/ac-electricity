# Television

## History

The history of television spans more than a century and reflects breakthroughs in science, engineering, culture, and communication.

**Early Mechanical Television (Late 19th – Early 20th Century)**  
Inventors such as Paul Nipkow, John Logie Baird, and Charles Francis Jenkins experimented with mechanical scanning systems that used rotating disks to capture and display images. These early devices laid the foundation for electronic television.

**Electronic Television (1920s–1930s)**  
The transition to electronic systems revolutionized television. In 1927, Philo Farnsworth demonstrated the first fully electronic television using cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Around the same time, Vladimir Zworykin developed the Iconoscope, another key early electronic camera tube.

**First Television Broadcasts (1930s)**  
The 1930s saw experimental broadcasting from organizations like the BBC (UK) and NBC (US). These broadcasts included news, entertainment, sports, and educational content.

**World War II and Postwar Expansion (1940s–1950s)**  
After World War II, television adoption skyrocketed. Improved manufacturing, decreased costs, and expanding broadcast networks brought TV into millions of homes. Programming diversified into sitcoms, dramas, game shows, and live events.

**Color Television (1950s–1960s)**  
Color broadcasting dramatically improved the viewing experience. The United States led the rollout in the early 1950s, and global networks gradually transitioned from black-and-white to full color.

**Cable and Satellite Television (1960s–1970s)**  
Cable TV broadened viewing options, enabling clearer reception and more channels. Networks like HBO and CNN introduced premium content and 24-hour news. Satellite technology enabled global transmission and the rise of international broadcasting.

**Digital Television and High Definition (1990s–2000s)**  
The transition from analog to digital brought higher picture quality, clearer audio, and new features like electronic program guides. High-definition (HD) technology further enhanced detail, contrast, and realism.

**Streaming and Internet Television (2000s–Present)**  
High-speed internet and digital platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and YouTube reshaped media consumption. On-demand viewing, binge-watching culture, and original streaming content have transformed the television landscape.

## How It Works

Modern televisions convert electrical signals into moving images and sound through a series of coordinated systems.

1. **Power Source**  
   The TV connects to an AC power outlet, supplying energy for all internal components.

2. **Power Supply Unit**  
   The AC power is converted to DC power, which drives the TV’s circuits, processors, and display.

3. **Tuner (for antenna/cable input)**  
   The tuner extracts the selected channel from incoming RF signals and converts it into a format suitable for internal processing.

4. **Signal Processing**  
   Video processors handle image scaling, color correction, noise reduction, and motion enhancement. Audio processors decode and amplify sound data.

5. **Display Panel**  
   Modern TVs use LCD, LED-LCD, QLED, OLED, MicroLED, or similar technology. Each pixel (and its subpixels) adjusts color and brightness to form the image.

6. **Backlighting (LCD-based displays)**  
   LCD panels require a backlight, traditionally from fluorescent lamps but now mostly from LEDs. Brightness and contrast are dynamically controlled for better picture quality.

7. **Sound System**  
   Built-in speakers convert processed audio signals into sound waves. Some TVs include multiple drivers, virtual surround systems, or support for external soundbars.

8. **User Interface**  
   Remote controls, on-screen menus, voice control, and smart OS platforms (Android TV, Roku, webOS, Tizen, etc.) allow users to navigate apps, settings, and inputs.

A television integrates display technology, audio systems, and digital processing to present synchronized moving images and sound.
