# Oven

An electric oven operates by using electrical energy to generate heat for cooking and baking. Here's how it works:

1. **Power Supply**: The electric oven is connected to a power source, typically a dedicated electrical circuit in a household, with higher voltage and current capacity compared to regular outlets.

2. **Heating Elements**: Electric ovens contain one or more heating elements made of a resistive material such as nichrome wire. These heating elements are located either at the top or bottom of the oven cavity, or both. Some ovens also have additional heating elements located on the sides for more even heat distribution.

3. **Thermal Regulation**: Electric ovens are equipped with temperature sensors or thermostats that monitor the temperature inside the oven cavity. When the oven is turned on and the desired temperature is set using the oven controls, electricity is supplied to the heating elements. As the temperature rises, the thermostat monitors the temperature and cycles the heating elements on and off to maintain the set temperature.

4. **Convection Fans (Optional)**: Some electric ovens are equipped with convection fans that circulate hot air throughout the oven cavity. This helps to distribute heat more evenly and can reduce cooking times. The convection fan is typically powered by electricity and controlled by the oven's electronic control system.

5. **Cooking Modes and Settings**: Electric ovens often offer different cooking modes and settings, such as bake, broil, roast, and convection bake. These settings adjust the operation of the heating elements and convection fan, if present, to suit different cooking needs and recipes.

6. **Oven Light and Door Lock Mechanism**: Electric ovens may have a built-in light to illuminate the oven cavity during cooking. Additionally, some ovens have a door lock mechanism that automatically locks the oven door during the self-cleaning cycle, which typically involves heating the oven to a very high temperature to burn off food residues.

7. **Control Panel**: The oven's control panel allows the user to set the desired cooking temperature, cooking mode, and cooking time. It also provides feedback such as temperature displays and indicator lights to inform the user of the oven's status.

Overall, an electric oven works by converting electrical energy into heat energy using resistive heating elements, with temperature regulation and control mechanisms to ensure precise and consistent cooking results.
