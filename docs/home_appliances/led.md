# LED

## History

**Early Discoveries**: The phenomenon of electroluminescence, the emission of light from a material when an electric current is passed through it, was first observed in the early 20th century. In 1907, British experimenter H.J. Round observed faint light emission from a silicon carbide (carborundum) crystal when an electric current was passed through it.

**First Practical LED**: In 1962, American engineer Nick Holonyak Jr. working at General Electric (GE) developed the first practical visible-spectrum LED. Holonyak's LED emitted red light and was made from gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP). This breakthrough marked the birth of the modern LED.

**Further Development**: In the following years, researchers made significant progress in improving LED technology. In 1972, M. George Craford, also working at GE, developed the first yellow LED by using gallium phosphide (GaP) as the semiconductor material. This expanded the color range of LEDs.

**Advancements in Colors**: Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, researchers continued to develop LEDs capable of emitting light across a wider range of colors. By combining different semiconductor materials, such as gallium nitride (GaN) and indium gallium nitride (InGaN), LEDs capable of emitting blue, green, and eventually white light were created.

**High-Brightness LEDs**: In the 1990s, advancements in semiconductor technology and manufacturing processes led to the development of high-brightness LEDs (HB-LEDs). These LEDs were significantly brighter and more efficient than their predecessors, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including automotive lighting, displays, and indicators.

**White LEDs**: One of the most significant advancements in LED technology was the development of white LEDs. Unlike traditional LEDs that emit monochromatic light, white LEDs produce a broad spectrum of light by combining blue or ultraviolet LEDs with a phosphor coating that converts some of the blue light into other colors, including red and green. White LEDs revolutionized lighting technology and led to the widespread adoption of LED lighting for various applications, including residential, commercial, and outdoor lighting.

**Ongoing Innovations**: Since the early 2000s, LED technology has continued to advance rapidly. Today, LEDs are not only more energy-efficient and longer-lasting than traditional lighting sources but also offer superior color quality, controllability, and design flexibility. Ongoing research and development efforts are focused on further improving efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding the range of applications for LED lighting.

## How it works

From an electrical point of view, a light-emitting diode (LED) works based on a phenomenon called electroluminescence, which is the emission of light when electrons recombine with electron holes within a semiconductor material. Here's a simplified explanation of how an LED works:

1. **Semiconductor Material**: An LED consists of a semiconductor material, typically composed of compounds such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium nitride (GaN), or indium gallium nitride (InGaN). These materials have specific properties that allow them to emit light when electrically charged.

2. **P-N Junction**: The semiconductor material of an LED is doped to create a p-n junction, where p-type (positively charged) and n-type (negatively charged) regions meet. The p-type region has an excess of positively charged "holes" (absence of electrons), while the n-type region has an excess of negatively charged electrons.

3. **Forward Bias**: When a voltage is applied across the p-n junction of the LED in the forward direction (positive voltage applied to the p-type region and negative voltage applied to the n-type region), it allows current to flow through the diode. Electrons from the n-type region and holes from the p-type region begin to move toward the junction.

4. **Electron-Hole Recombination**: As electrons and holes move toward the p-n junction, they recombine at the junction. When an electron recombines with a hole, it releases energy in the form of a photon (light particle). The energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy band gap of the semiconductor material, determining the color of the emitted light.

5. **Light Emission**: The recombination of electrons and holes at the p-n junction results in the emission of light. The semiconductor material and the design of the LED structure determine the wavelength (color) of the emitted light. Different semiconductor materials and doping techniques can produce LEDs that emit light across a wide range of colors, including red, green, blue, and white.

6. **Efficiency and Control**: LEDs are highly efficient at converting electrical energy into light, with minimal energy wasted as heat. The intensity of light emitted by an LED can be controlled by varying the current flowing through it. Additionally, the design of the LED package and the application of phosphor coatings can further enhance the color quality and brightness of the emitted light.

Overall, LEDs provide a highly efficient and controllable source of light, making them widely used in various applications, including lighting, displays, indicators, and electronic devices.
