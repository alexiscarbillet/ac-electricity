# Nichrome

## History

Nichrome is an alloy primarily composed of nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr), with smaller amounts of other elements such as iron (Fe). It is known for its high electrical resistance, making it suitable for use as a heating element in electrical appliances. Here are some historical facts about the use of nichrome as an electrical conductor:

**Discovery**: Nichrome was first developed in the early 20th century, around 1905, by Albert Marsh, an American engineer working for the Hoskins Manufacturing Company in New Haven, Connecticut. Marsh was tasked with finding a suitable material for use as a heating element in toasters, as existing materials were prone to breakage and corrosion.

**Composition**: Nichrome is typically composed of approximately 80% nickel and 20% chromium, although the exact composition may vary depending on the desired properties. The addition of chromium to nickel increases the alloy's resistance to oxidation and corrosion, making it more durable at high temperatures.

**Properties**: Nichrome exhibits high electrical resistance, low temperature coefficient of resistance, and good mechanical strength at elevated temperatures. These properties make it well-suited for use as a heating element in appliances such as toasters, ovens, hair dryers, and electric furnaces.

**Commercialization**: Nichrome quickly gained popularity for its superior performance as a heating element compared to other materials such as iron or copper wires. Its ability to withstand high temperatures without significant deformation or oxidation made it an ideal choice for heating applications in various industries.

**Applications**: Nichrome is widely used in household appliances and industrial equipment where controlled heating is required. Some common applications include:

   - Toaster heating elements

   - Electric stove coils

   - Heating elements in hair dryers and curling irons

   - Electric furnaces and kilns

   - Industrial heating coils for process heating and melting applications

**Continued Use**: Despite the development of alternative materials and heating technologies, nichrome remains a popular choice for heating elements due to its reliability, durability, and cost-effectiveness. It continues to be widely used in both consumer and industrial applications around the world.

## How it works

Nichrome works as an electrical conductor primarily due to its high electrical resistance and ability to generate heat efficiently when an electric current passes through it. Here's a detailed explanation of how nichrome works:

**Composition**: Nichrome is an alloy composed primarily of nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr), with smaller amounts of other elements such as iron (Fe). The exact composition of nichrome can vary depending on the specific application and desired properties.

**Electrical Resistance**: Nichrome has a relatively high electrical resistance compared to pure metals like copper or aluminum. This high resistance is due to the alloy's composition and crystalline structure, which hinder the flow of electrons through the material.

**Joule Heating**: When an electric current is passed through a nichrome wire or heating element, the resistance of the material causes it to heat up. This phenomenon is known as Joule heating, named after James Prescott Joule, who first discovered it in the mid-19th century.

**Power Dissipation**: According to Joule's Law, the amount of heat produced (power dissipated) in a resistor is proportional to the square of the current passing through it and the resistance of the resistor. Therefore, nichrome's high resistance results in significant power dissipation and heat generation when an electric current is applied.

**Temperature Control**: The resistance of nichrome increases with temperature, which means that as the wire heats up, its resistance also increases. This property provides a form of self-regulation for nichrome heating elements, as the increase in resistance reduces the current flowing through the wire, thereby limiting further heating.

**Applications**: Nichrome's ability to efficiently generate heat makes it suitable for a wide range of heating applications, including:

   - Toaster heating elements

   - Electric stove coils

   - Heating elements in hair dryers, curling irons, and clothes irons

   - Electric furnaces and kilns

   - Industrial heating coils for process heating and melting applications

**Longevity and Durability**: Nichrome is valued for its durability and longevity, even when exposed to high temperatures for extended periods. Its resistance to oxidation and corrosion, particularly at elevated temperatures, ensures that nichrome heating elements maintain their performance over time.

In summary, nichrome works as an electrical conductor by efficiently converting electrical energy into heat through the phenomenon of Joule heating. Its high resistance, self-regulating properties, and durability make it an ideal choice for various heating applications in both consumer and industrial settings.
