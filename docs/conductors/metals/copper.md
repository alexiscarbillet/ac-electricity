# Copper

## History

Copper has a long history of being used as an electrical conductor, dating back thousands of years. Here are some historical facts about the use of copper in electrical conductivity:

**Ancient Use**: Copper has been used by ancient civilizations for various purposes, including as an electrical conductor. The earliest evidence of copper use dates back to around 10,000 years ago, with copper artifacts found in archaeological sites in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.

**Egyptian and Mesopotamian Civilizations**: Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians utilized copper for making jewelry, tools, and decorative items. Copper was also used in early electrical applications, such as the production of copper wires for electrical connections in lamps and other devices.

**Discovery of Electricity**: The modern understanding of electricity began to emerge in the 17th and 18th centuries. Copper played a crucial role in early experiments and discoveries in electricity. Notably, the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta constructed the first electric battery, known as the Voltaic pile, in 1800, using copper and zinc plates to generate an electric current.

**Telegraphy and Electrical Communication**: Copper became indispensable in the development of telegraphy and electrical communication systems in the 19th century. Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph in the 1830s relied on copper wires to transmit electrical signals over long distances, revolutionizing communication.

**Industrialization and Electrical Grids**: The widespread use of copper in electrical infrastructure grew significantly during the Industrial Revolution. Copper became the preferred material for electrical wiring and conductors due to its excellent conductivity, malleability, and corrosion resistance. Copper wires were used to establish electrical grids for powering factories, homes, and cities.

**Advancements in Copper Production**: Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, advancements in copper mining and production techniques led to increased availability and affordability of copper. Innovations in smelting, refining, and alloying processes improved the quality and purity of copper, making it even more suitable for electrical applications.

**Modern Applications**: Copper remains one of the most widely used materials in electrical engineering and technology. It is used in various applications, including electrical wiring and cables, motors, transformers, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and telecommunications equipment. Copper's high conductivity and reliability make it indispensable in modern electrical systems.

**Research and Development**: Despite its long history of use, ongoing research and development continue to explore new applications and innovations involving copper as an electrical conductor. This includes efforts to improve energy efficiency, develop new copper alloys, and explore copper's potential in emerging technologies such as renewable energy systems and electric vehicles.

## How it works

Let's explore in detail how copper works as an electrical conductor:

1. **Atomic Structure**: Copper is a metal with a crystalline structure, characterized by closely packed atoms arranged in a regular lattice. In its pure form, each copper atom contributes one valence electron to the electron cloud, creating a sea of delocalized electrons throughout the metal.

2. **Free Electron Model**: According to the free electron model of metals, the valence electrons in copper are not tightly bound to individual atoms but are free to move throughout the material. When a voltage is applied across a copper conductor, an electric field is established, exerting a force on these free electrons.

3. **Electric Conduction Mechanism**: The movement of free electrons in response to the applied electric field constitutes an electric current. As electrons drift in the direction of the electric field, they collide with lattice defects, imperfections, and impurities within the copper lattice, as well as with other electrons. Despite these collisions, the net movement of electrons results in the flow of current through the conductor.

4. **High Conductivity**: Copper exhibits high electrical conductivity due to several factors. Firstly, the delocalized electrons in copper can move freely over long distances without significant resistance, resulting in low electrical resistivity. Additionally, copper has a high electron mobility, meaning that electrons can move rapidly through the lattice when subjected to an electric field.

5. **Low Resistivity**: Copper's low electrical resistivity (around 1.68 Ã— 10^-8 ohm-meters at room temperature) makes it an excellent conductor of electricity. Resistivity is a measure of a material's ability to impede the flow of electric current, and copper's low resistivity means that it offers minimal resistance to the flow of electrons.

6. **Temperature Dependence**: The conductivity of copper is also influenced by temperature. Generally, as temperature increases, the resistance of copper increases slightly due to increased atomic vibrations, which impede the movement of electrons. However, compared to many other metals, copper exhibits relatively low temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning its conductivity remains high over a wide range of temperatures.

7. **Applications**: Copper's exceptional conductivity makes it indispensable in various electrical applications. It is used in electrical wiring and cables, where it conducts electricity from power sources to electrical devices with minimal energy loss. Copper is also utilized in motors, transformers, printed circuit boards (PCBs), telecommunications equipment, and numerous other electrical components.

In summary, copper works as an electrical conductor due to its crystalline structure, delocalized electrons, high electron mobility, and low resistivity. These properties allow electrons to move freely through the copper lattice, resulting in efficient conduction of electricity with minimal resistance. Copper's widespread use in electrical engineering and technology is a testament to its exceptional conductivity and reliability.
