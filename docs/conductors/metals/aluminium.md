# Aluminium

## History

Here are some historical facts about the use of aluminum as an electrical conductor:

**Discovery and Early Use**: Aluminum was discovered in the early 19th century, but it was initially considered a precious metal due to the difficulty and expense of extracting it from its ores. However, advancements in extraction and refining techniques in the late 19th and early 20th centuries made aluminum more accessible and affordable.

**Introduction to Electrical Conductivity**: While aluminum was first used in non-electrical applications such as decorative items and utensils, its high electrical conductivity was recognized relatively early on. In the late 19th century, researchers and engineers began to explore aluminum's potential for use in electrical conductors.

**First Aluminum Conductors**: One of the earliest notable uses of aluminum as an electrical conductor was in the construction of the electrical grid for the Niagara Falls hydroelectric power plant in the late 19th century. Aluminum was used alongside copper in overhead power lines due to its lighter weight and lower cost.

**Advantages over Copper**: Aluminum's advantages over copper as an electrical conductor include its lower density (approximately one-third that of copper), which makes it lighter and easier to handle, particularly for overhead transmission lines. Additionally, aluminum is less expensive than copper, making it an attractive alternative for large-scale electrical infrastructure projects.

**Aluminum Wiring**: In the mid-20th century, aluminum wiring gained popularity in residential and commercial construction due to its lower cost compared to copper. However, concerns arose about the potential for aluminum wiring to overheat and cause electrical fires due to its lower conductivity and greater susceptibility to oxidation and expansion.

**Modern Usage**: Despite the challenges associated with aluminum wiring in the past, aluminum continues to be widely used in electrical applications, particularly in high-voltage transmission lines, where its light weight and lower cost provide significant advantages. Aluminum conductors are also used in various industrial and commercial applications, including motors, transformers, and electrical cables.

**Aluminum Alloys**: To address some of the drawbacks of pure aluminum as an electrical conductor, aluminum alloys have been developed. These alloys may incorporate elements such as copper, magnesium, or silicon to improve conductivity, strength, and resistance to corrosion.

**Research and Development**: Ongoing research and development efforts continue to explore ways to optimize aluminum alloys for use as electrical conductors. This includes developing new alloy compositions, refining manufacturing processes, and improving surface treatments to enhance conductivity, mechanical properties, and longevity.

## How it works

Let's delve into the details of how aluminum works as an electrical conductor:

**Atomic Structure**: Aluminum is a metal with a crystalline structure, characterized by closely packed atoms arranged in a regular lattice. In its pure form, each aluminum atom contributes three valence electrons to the electron cloud, creating a sea of delocalized electrons throughout the metal.

**Free Electron Model**: Similar to other metals, the valence electrons in aluminum are not tightly bound to individual atoms but are free to move throughout the material. When a voltage is applied across an aluminum conductor, an electric field is established, exerting a force on these free electrons.

**Electric Conduction Mechanism**: The movement of free electrons in response to the applied electric field constitutes an electric current. As electrons drift in the direction of the electric field, they collide with lattice defects, imperfections, and impurities within the aluminum lattice, as well as with other electrons. Despite these collisions, the net movement of electrons results in the flow of current through the conductor.

**High Conductivity**: Aluminum exhibits good electrical conductivity due to several factors. Firstly, the delocalized electrons in aluminum can move freely over long distances without significant resistance, resulting in low electrical resistivity. Additionally, aluminum has a relatively high electron mobility, meaning that electrons can move rapidly through the lattice when subjected to an electric field.

**Low Resistivity**: Aluminum's low electrical resistivity (around 2.7 Ã— 10^-8 ohm-meters at room temperature) makes it an excellent conductor of electricity. Resistivity is a measure of a material's ability to impede the flow of electric current, and aluminum's low resistivity means that it offers minimal resistance to the flow of electrons.

**Temperature Dependence**: The conductivity of aluminum is also influenced by temperature. Generally, as temperature increases, the resistance of aluminum increases slightly due to increased atomic vibrations, which impede the movement of electrons. However, compared to many other materials, aluminum exhibits a relatively low temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning its conductivity remains relatively stable over a wide range of temperatures.

**Applications**: Aluminum's excellent conductivity makes it indispensable in various electrical applications. It is commonly used in overhead power lines, where its lighter weight compared to copper reduces the strain on support structures. Aluminum conductors are also used in electrical wiring and cables, transformers, motors, electrical enclosures, and many other electrical components and devices.

In summary, aluminum works as an electrical conductor due to its crystalline structure, delocalized electrons, high electron mobility, and low resistivity. These properties allow electrons to move freely through the aluminum lattice, resulting in efficient conduction of electricity with minimal resistance. Aluminum's widespread use in electrical engineering and technology is a testament to its exceptional conductivity and versatility.
