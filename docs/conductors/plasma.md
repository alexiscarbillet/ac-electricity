# Plasma

## History

Here are some historical facts about the use of plasma as an electrical conductor:

**Discovery of Plasma**: The concept of plasma was first proposed by American physicist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s. Langmuir described plasma as a distinct state of matter consisting of ionized gases, characterized by the presence of free electrons and positively charged ions.

**Early Research**: In the 1930s and 1940s, researchers began studying plasma in various experimental setups. One significant area of study was the behavior of plasma in electric fields. Scientists observed that plasma could conduct electricity due to the presence of free-moving charged particles.

**Fusion Research**: Plasma's role as an electrical conductor became particularly significant in the field of nuclear fusion research. In the quest to achieve controlled nuclear fusion, scientists needed a medium to contain and heat the fusion fuel, such as hydrogen isotopes, to the extreme temperatures required for fusion reactions. Plasma, with its ability to conduct electricity and withstand high temperatures, became the focus of research for fusion confinement.

**Tokamak Development**: One of the most prominent devices for studying plasma as a conductor in fusion research is the tokamak. The tokamak is a doughnut-shaped device that uses magnetic fields to confine and control the plasma. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, tokamaks rely on the conductivity of plasma to sustain the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion.

**Magnetic Confinement Fusion**: Plasma's role as an electrical conductor is essential in magnetic confinement fusion approaches, where powerful magnetic fields are used to contain and stabilize the plasma. By inducing electrical currents within the plasma through magnetic fields, researchers can control its shape, stability, and temperature, enabling sustained fusion reactions.

**Plasma Applications**: Beyond fusion research, plasma's conductivity has found applications in various fields, including materials processing, semiconductor manufacturing, and plasma-based propulsion systems for spacecraft. In these applications, plasma is used as a medium to transfer and manipulate electrical energy for specific purposes.

**Space Exploration**: Plasma's role as an electrical conductor is also relevant in space physics and exploration. The ionized gases in space, such as those found in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, can conduct electricity and interact with electromagnetic fields, affecting phenomena like auroras and space weather.

## How it works

Let's delve into the details of how plasma functions as an electrical conductor:

1. **Ionization**: Plasma is often described as the fourth state of matter, distinct from solid, liquid, and gas. It is created when a gas is heated to extremely high temperatures, or subjected to a strong electromagnetic field, causing its atoms to ionize. Ionization involves the removal or addition of electrons from atoms, resulting in a mixture of positively charged ions and free electrons.

2. **Charge Carriers**: In a plasma, the free electrons and positively charged ions act as charge carriers. These charged particles are free to move within the plasma, responding to electric and magnetic fields. Unlike in a solid conductor where charge carriers are bound to specific atoms or lattice sites, in plasma, they are free to move over large distances.

3. **Electric Conductivity**: When an electric field is applied to a plasma, the free electrons and ions experience a force and begin to move. This movement of charged particles constitutes an electric current. Since plasma contains both positive and negative charges, it can conduct electricity, albeit with some differences compared to traditional conductors like metals.

4. **Collisional Processes**: In a plasma, charged particles can undergo collisions with one another and with neutral atoms or molecules. These collisions play a crucial role in determining the electrical conductivity of the plasma. Collisions between electrons and ions, known as electron-ion collisions, can transfer energy and momentum, affecting the overall behavior of the plasma.

5. **Plasma Parameters**: The electrical conductivity of plasma depends on various parameters, including the density of charged particles, temperature, and the strength of the electric and magnetic fields. Higher densities of charged particles and higher temperatures generally lead to higher conductivity.

6. **Magnetic Confinement**: In fusion research, magnetic fields are often used to confine and control the plasma. The charged particles in the plasma spiral along the magnetic field lines, effectively trapping them within a certain region. By inducing electric currents within the plasma through magnetic fields, researchers can control its shape, stability, and behavior, facilitating sustained fusion reactions.

7. **Applications**: Plasma's electrical conductivity has numerous applications across various fields. In addition to nuclear fusion research, plasma is used in technologies such as plasma cutting and welding, plasma TVs, fluorescent lighting, semiconductor manufacturing, and plasma thrusters for spacecraft propulsion.

In summary, plasma's ability to conduct electricity arises from the presence of charged particles (ions and electrons) that are free to move within the plasma, responding to applied electric and magnetic fields. This conductivity plays a crucial role in a wide range of scientific, industrial, and technological applications.
