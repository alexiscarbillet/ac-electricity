# Polyethylene

## History

Polyethylene, a versatile polymer, has found extensive use as an electrical insulator due to its favorable properties. Here are some historical facts about the use of polyethylene as an electrical insulant:

**Early Development**: Polyethylene was first synthesized in 1933 by British chemists Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) research laboratory in Northwich, England. Initially, its applications were limited, but its insulating properties were soon recognized.

**Commercialization**: In the late 1930s and early 1940s, commercial production of polyethylene began. Its excellent electrical insulating properties, combined with its affordability and ease of processing, led to its widespread adoption in electrical applications.

**Dielectric Strength**: One of the key properties that make polyethylene suitable as an electrical insulator is its high dielectric strength. This property allows it to withstand high voltages without conducting electricity, making it ideal for use in cables, wires, and electrical components.

**Cable Insulation**: Polyethylene became a popular choice for insulation in electrical cables and wires due to its ability to provide reliable electrical insulation while also offering mechanical protection. It replaced traditional materials like paper and rubber in many applications.

**Low Water Absorption**: Polyethylene has low water absorption, which helps maintain its insulating properties even in humid environments. This characteristic makes it particularly suitable for outdoor applications where exposure to moisture is a concern.

**Cross-Linking**: Over time, advancements in polyethylene technology led to the development of cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation. XLPE offers improved thermal and mechanical properties compared to traditional polyethylene, further expanding its use in high-voltage applications such as power distribution.

**Modern Applications**: Today, polyethylene and XLPE are widely used as electrical insulants in a variety of applications, including power cables for transmission and distribution, telecommunications cables, electrical connectors, insulating tapes, and capacitors.

**Regulatory Standards**: Various international standards and regulations govern the use of polyethylene and XLPE in electrical applications, ensuring that they meet stringent safety and performance requirements.

## How it works

Polyethylene (PE) is a great electrical insulator due to several key properties that contribute to its effectiveness in preventing the flow of electrical current.

1. **High Resistivity**: Polyethylene has a high resistivity, meaning it offers significant opposition to the flow of electric current. Resistivity is a measure of a material's ability to resist the passage of electrical current under the influence of an electric field. In polyethylene, the tightly packed molecular structure and absence of free ions contribute to its high resistivity.

2. **Dielectric Constant**: Polyethylene has a relatively low dielectric constant, which is a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy in an electric field. A low dielectric constant means that polyethylene exhibits low capacitance, reducing its ability to store charge and conduct electricity.

3. **Dielectric Strength**: Polyethylene exhibits a high dielectric strength, which is the maximum electric field that a material can withstand without experiencing electrical breakdown. The high dielectric strength of polyethylene allows it to withstand high voltages without conducting electricity or undergoing breakdown, making it suitable for insulation in high-voltage applications.

4. **Molecular Structure**: The molecular structure of polyethylene plays a crucial role in its electrical insulation properties. Polyethylene consists of long chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms bonded to them. This molecular structure results in a non-polar, linear polymer chain arrangement, which reduces the likelihood of charge carriers (such as electrons) moving freely through the material.

5. **Low Water Absorption**: Polyethylene has low water absorption, which helps maintain its insulating properties even in humid or wet environments. Water molecules can act as charge carriers and reduce the effectiveness of insulation materials, but the low water absorption of polyethylene minimizes this effect.

6. **Chemical Stability**: Polyethylene is chemically stable and resistant to degradation from environmental factors such as moisture, sunlight, and chemicals. This stability ensures the long-term reliability of polyethylene insulation in electrical applications.

7. **Flexibility and Durability**: Polyethylene insulation is flexible and durable, making it suitable for use in a wide range of applications, including cables and wires that may undergo bending, twisting, or other mechanical stress.
