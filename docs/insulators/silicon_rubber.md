# Silicon rubber

## History

Silicone rubber, also known as polysiloxane, has a long history of use as an electrical insulant due to its unique combination of properties. Here are some historical facts about the use of silicone rubber in electrical insulation:

**Early Development**: Silicone rubber was first synthesized in the early 20th century by chemists investigating the reactions of silicon compounds. The commercial production of silicone rubber began in the 1940s, primarily by companies like Dow Corning and General Electric.

**Electrical Insulation Applications**: Silicone rubber was initially used as an electrical insulator in applications where traditional materials like natural rubber or PVC (polyvinyl chloride) couldn't meet the performance requirements. Its excellent electrical insulation properties, combined with high thermal stability and resistance to environmental factors, made it well-suited for a wide range of electrical applications.

**High Temperature Resistance**: One of the key advantages of silicone rubber as an electrical insulant is its ability to withstand high temperatures without losing its electrical properties. This property made it particularly valuable in applications where exposure to heat is a concern, such as high-voltage power cables, electrical connectors, and insulating tapes for motors and generators.

**Flexibility and Durability**: Silicone rubber is highly flexible and resilient, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress and vibration without compromising its insulating properties. This flexibility made it suitable for use in cables and wires that require frequent bending and movement.

**Weather and Chemical Resistance**: Silicone rubber exhibits excellent resistance to weathering, UV radiation, ozone, and many chemicals. This resistance ensures the long-term reliability of silicone rubber insulation in outdoor and harsh environments where exposure to environmental factors can degrade other insulating materials.

**Silicone Coatings**: In addition to solid silicone rubber insulation, silicone coatings have been widely used to provide electrical insulation in various applications. Silicone coatings can be applied to surfaces to provide a protective barrier against moisture, corrosion, and electrical leakage.

**Advancements in Formulations**: Over time, advancements in silicone rubber formulations have led to the development of specialized grades tailored to specific electrical insulation applications. These formulations may include additives to enhance properties such as flame resistance, thermal conductivity, or dielectric strength.

**Regulatory Standards**: Various international standards and regulations govern the use of silicone rubber in electrical insulation applications, ensuring that it meets stringent safety and performance requirements.

## How it works

Silicone rubber is widely regarded as an excellent electrical insulator due to several key properties that contribute to its effectiveness in preventing the flow of electrical current. Here's a detailed explanation of why silicone rubber is a great electrical insulant and how it works:

1. **High Resistivity**: Silicone rubber exhibits high resistivity, which means it offers significant opposition to the flow of electric current. Resistivity is a measure of a material's ability to resist the passage of electrical current under the influence of an electric field. In silicone rubber, the long-chain molecular structure consisting of silicon-oxygen (Si-O) bonds creates a highly stable and non-conductive material.

2. **Dielectric Strength**: Silicone rubber possesses a high dielectric strength, which is the maximum electric field that a material can withstand without experiencing electrical breakdown. The strong Si-O bonds in silicone rubber provide excellent insulation properties, allowing it to withstand high voltages without conducting electricity or undergoing breakdown.

3. **Thermal Stability**: One of the remarkable characteristics of silicone rubber is its ability to maintain its electrical insulation properties over a wide temperature range. Silicone rubber can withstand both high and low temperatures without significant changes in its dielectric properties, making it suitable for use in applications where temperature variations are expected.

4. **Flexibility and Elasticity**: Silicone rubber is highly flexible and elastic, allowing it to conform to irregular shapes and withstand mechanical stress without compromising its insulation properties. This flexibility makes silicone rubber suitable for use in cables, wires, and electrical components that may undergo bending, twisting, or vibration.

5. **Weather and Environmental Resistance**: Silicone rubber exhibits excellent resistance to weathering, UV radiation, ozone, moisture, and many chemicals. This resistance ensures the long-term reliability of silicone rubber insulation in outdoor and harsh environments where exposure to environmental factors can degrade other insulating materials.

6. **Chemical Inertness**: Silicone rubber is chemically inert and does not react with most chemicals, which contributes to its stability and longevity in various applications. This property makes silicone rubber insulation suitable for use in environments where exposure to corrosive chemicals is a concern.

7. **Low Water Absorption**: Silicone rubber has low water absorption, which helps maintain its insulating properties even in humid or wet conditions. Water absorption can degrade the performance of insulating materials by increasing conductivity, but the low water absorption of silicone rubber minimizes this effect.

8. **Non-Toxicity and Safety**: Silicone rubber is non-toxic, odorless, and safe for use in electrical applications. It does not emit harmful gases or fumes when exposed to heat or flame, making it suitable for use in applications where safety is a priority.
