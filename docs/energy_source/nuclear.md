# Nuclear

Nuclear power is one of the most powerful and energy-dense methods of electricity generation, relying on the energy released from atomic nuclei. Despite its controversies and historical accidents, it remains a major contributor to global low-carbon electricity production.

## History

The history of nuclear energy is marked by groundbreaking discoveries, engineering milestones, and pivotal global events that shaped both technology and public perception.

### Discovery of Nuclear Fission (1938)

The foundation of nuclear power began in **1938**, when German chemists **Otto Hahn** and **Fritz Strassmann** discovered **nuclear fission** — the process of splitting an atom’s nucleus into smaller parts, releasing enormous energy.  
Physicists **Lise Meitner** and **Otto Frisch** later provided the theoretical explanation, revealing the immense potential of this reaction for both military and peaceful purposes.

### The Manhattan Project (1942–1946)

During **World War II**, the **Manhattan Project**, a joint effort by the **United States**, **United Kingdom**, and **Canada**, developed the first nuclear weapons.  
While its immediate outcome was military, the project established the scientific and technical foundation for future **civilian nuclear power**.

### Experimental Breeder Reactor I (1951)

On **December 20, 1951**, the **Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I)** in **Idaho, USA**, became the first reactor to generate usable electricity from nuclear energy — enough to light four bulbs, and later power the entire facility.  
This milestone demonstrated the practical potential of nuclear fission for electricity generation.

### Calder Hall (1956)

In **1956**, **Calder Hall** in the **United Kingdom** became the world’s **first commercial nuclear power station** to supply electricity to a national grid.  
Using a **gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor**, Calder Hall marked the official beginning of the **civil nuclear energy era**.

### Shippingport Atomic Power Station (1957)

The **Shippingport Atomic Power Station**, located near **Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**, began operation in **1957** as the first **full-scale commercial nuclear power plant** in the United States.  
Dedicated entirely to peaceful applications, it symbolized the shift from military to civilian nuclear technology.

### Three Mile Island Accident (1979)

In **1979**, a **partial meltdown** occurred at the **Three Mile Island** plant in **Pennsylvania, USA**.  
Although it caused no direct fatalities, the incident dramatically changed **public perception**, leading to stricter **safety regulations** and greater scrutiny of nuclear operations worldwide.

### Chernobyl Disaster (1986)

The **Chernobyl** disaster in **Ukraine** (then part of the Soviet Union) in **1986** remains the **worst nuclear accident in history**.  
Caused by design flaws and operator errors during a test, the explosion released massive amounts of **radioactive material**, contaminating large regions and impacting global nuclear policies for decades.

### Fukushima Daiichi Disaster (2011)

Triggered by a **massive earthquake and tsunami**, the **Fukushima Daiichi** disaster in **Japan (2011)** led to core meltdowns, hydrogen explosions, and widespread contamination.  
It became the most severe nuclear event since Chernobyl, sparking renewed debates about **nuclear safety**, **emergency preparedness**, and **waste management**.

Despite these major incidents, nuclear power remains a key part of the global energy mix. Continuous improvements in **reactor design**, **safety protocols**, and **waste management** aim to make nuclear energy safer and more sustainable for the future.

## How It Works

Nuclear power plants generate electricity through **nuclear fission** — splitting atomic nuclei to release energy as heat. This heat is used to produce steam, which drives turbines connected to generators.

### 1. Nuclear Fission

- The process begins when a **neutron** strikes the nucleus of a **uranium-235 (²³⁵U)** or **plutonium-239 (²³⁹Pu)** atom.  
- The nucleus splits into smaller fragments, releasing **energy**, **radiation**, and **more neutrons**, which can trigger additional fission reactions — forming a **self-sustaining chain reaction**.

### 2. Fuel Rods

- The main fuel is **enriched uranium**, which contains a higher proportion of uranium-235.  
- Uranium is pressed into **ceramic pellets**, stacked inside **metal tubes** called **fuel rods**.  
- Dozens of fuel rods form a **fuel assembly**, and multiple assemblies make up the **reactor core**.

### 3. Control Rods

- **Control rods**, typically made of **boron**, **cadmium**, or **hafnium**, absorb excess neutrons.  
- By raising or lowering these rods into the reactor core, operators can **regulate the fission rate**, maintaining a stable and safe reaction.

### 4. Heat Generation

- Each fission event releases substantial **heat energy**.  
- This heat is transferred to a **coolant** (usually water), circulating through the reactor core to capture and carry the thermal energy.

### 5. Steam Generation

- The hot coolant flows through a **heat exchanger**, heating a separate loop of water to create **high-pressure steam**.  
- This **closed-loop system** ensures radioactive materials remain isolated from the turbine cycle.

### 6. Turbine and Generator

- The **steam** drives a **turbine**, which spins a **generator** to produce **electricity** through **electromagnetic induction**.  
- The resulting electricity is fed into the **power grid** for consumer and industrial use.

### 7. Cooling Systems

- After the steam passes through the turbine, it is **condensed** back into water in the **condenser**.  
- **Cooling towers** or **natural water sources** (such as rivers or oceans) dissipate excess heat.  
- The condensed water is recycled back into the system, completing the loop.

### 8. Safety Systems

Nuclear plants include multiple, redundant safety mechanisms to ensure secure operation:
- **Reactor containment structures** to prevent radioactive release.  
- **Emergency core cooling systems (ECCS)** to maintain coolant flow.  
- **Automatic shutdown systems** (SCRAM) to rapidly halt fission reactions.  
- **Backup generators** to ensure continuous power for safety systems during outages.

## Summary

Nuclear power converts the immense energy within atomic nuclei into electricity through controlled fission.  
It offers major advantages — such as **high energy density**, **low greenhouse gas emissions**, and **consistent output** — but also presents challenges involving **safety**, **radioactive waste**, and **public trust**.

As next-generation technologies like **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** and **fusion research** advance, nuclear energy continues to play a crucial role in the transition toward a **cleaner and more resilient global energy system**.
