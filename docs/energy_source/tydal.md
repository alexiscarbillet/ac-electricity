# Tidal Energy

## History

The idea of harnessing tidal energy dates back centuries, but it wasn’t until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that real progress was made in using it to generate electricity. Below is an overview of key milestones in tidal energy development.

**Early Experiments**

- Ancient civilizations such as the Romans and Greeks used *tidal mills* to grind grain. These mills, built along estuaries or tidal rivers, converted the motion of tidal water into mechanical power.
- By the 11th century, tidal mills were widespread in England, as documented in the *Domesday Book*.

**La Rance Tidal Power Plant (1966)**

- Located on the Rance River in Brittany, France, the **La Rance Tidal Power Plant** is one of the earliest large-scale tidal power stations.
- Completed in 1966, it was the world’s first major tidal power facility, using a **barrage system** — a dam built across an estuary to capture tidal flows.
- With an installed capacity of **240 MW**, La Rance has operated successfully for decades, supplying clean electricity to the French grid.

**Other Early Projects**

- Inspired by La Rance’s success, several countries pursued their own tidal projects in regions with strong tidal currents, such as the **Bay of Fundy** (Canada) and the **Severn Estuary** (United Kingdom).
- In the same year, the **Soviet Union** constructed a tidal power plant at Kislaya Guba Inlet in Russia, showing global interest in the technology.

**Modern Developments**

- In recent decades, growing concerns about climate change and advances in renewable technology have revived interest in tidal energy.
- New approaches like **tidal stream generators** and **underwater turbines** now harness the kinetic energy of moving water with less environmental impact than traditional barrages.
- Pilot projects have been established in several countries, including the **UK**, **Canada**, **South Korea**, and **China**, to evaluate the performance and efficiency of these systems.

While tidal energy still makes up a small portion of global electricity generation, ongoing research aims to improve its scalability and efficiency, potentially making it a stronger component of the world’s renewable energy mix.

## How It Works

Tidal energy can be captured in two main ways — by harnessing the **kinetic energy** of moving water (tidal streams) or the **potential energy** of changing tides (tidal barrages).

**Tidal Stream Systems**

- These systems work much like underwater wind turbines. They convert the kinetic energy of flowing water into electricity.
- Turbines are installed on the seabed in areas with strong tidal currents. As water moves through the blades, it causes them to spin, powering a generator.
- Effective site selection is crucial — the turbines must be placed in locations with consistent tidal flows, while minimizing disruption to marine ecosystems.

**Tidal Barrage Systems**

- Barrage systems capture the potential energy of rising and falling tides using a dam or barrier built across an estuary or bay.
- The structure contains turbines and sluice gates that control water flow during tidal cycles.
- As tides rise, water is trapped behind the barrage, creating a difference in water levels (a *head*). When the tide recedes, the trapped water is released through turbines, generating electricity.
- These systems provide predictable and reliable power but require specific geographic conditions — large tidal ranges and suitable estuaries.

In summary, **tidal stream systems** extract energy from moving water, while **tidal barrage systems** exploit the difference in water height. Both methods offer renewable and predictable sources of energy, and continuous innovation aims to make tidal power a more efficient and sustainable part of the global energy landscape.
