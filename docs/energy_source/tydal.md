# Tydal energy

## History

The concept of using tidal energy to generate electricity has been explored for centuries, but it wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that significant advancements were made in harnessing tidal power for electricity generation. Here are some historical facts about the development of tidal energy:

**Early Experiments:**

   - The idea of using tidal energy dates back to ancient times when civilizations like the Romans and Greeks used tidal mills to grind grain. These mills were simple structures built along estuaries or tidal rivers, utilizing the movement of water during tides to turn millstones and produce mechanical power.
   
   - In the 11th century, the Domesday Book mentions tidal mills in England, indicating their widespread use during that period.

**La Rance Tidal Power Plant (1966):**

   - The La Rance Tidal Power Plant, located on the Rance River in Brittany, France, is one of the earliest and most significant examples of tidal energy used for electricity generation.

   - Completed in 1966, the La Rance plant was the world's first large-scale tidal power station. It utilizes a barrage system, where a dam is built across an estuary to capture the incoming and outgoing tidal flow.

   - The plant has a total installed capacity of 240 megawatts (MW) and has been operating successfully for decades, supplying electricity to the grid.

**Other Early Projects:**

   - Following the success of the La Rance project, other countries began exploring tidal energy as a potential renewable energy source. Projects were proposed and developed in locations with strong tidal currents, such as the Bay of Fundy in Canada and the Severn Estuary in the United Kingdom.

   - In 1966, the Soviets constructed a tidal power plant on the Kislaya Guba Inlet in Russia, demonstrating the international interest in harnessing tidal energy.

**Modern Developments:**

   - In recent decades, technological advancements and increasing concerns about climate change and renewable energy have led to renewed interest in tidal energy.

   - Newer tidal energy technologies, such as tidal stream generators and tidal turbines, have been developed to harness the kinetic energy of tidal currents more efficiently and with less environmental impact than traditional barrage systems.

   - Pilot projects and demonstration sites have been established in various countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, and China, to test and evaluate these new technologies.

While tidal energy still represents a small fraction of the world's electricity generation, ongoing research and development efforts aim to further improve the efficiency and scalability of tidal power technologies, potentially making tidal energy a more significant contributor to global renewable energy portfolios in the future.

## How it works

Tidal energy is harnessed through various methods, primarily by capturing the kinetic energy of tidal currents or the potential energy of the changing tides. Here's an overview of the two main approaches:

**Tidal Stream Systems:**

   - Tidal stream systems work similarly to underwater wind turbines. They use the kinetic energy of moving water currents to generate electricity.

   - Tidal turbines are typically installed on the seabed in areas with strong tidal currents. These turbines resemble underwater wind turbines but are designed to operate in water instead of air.

   - As tidal currents flow past the turbine blades, they cause them to rotate. The rotating blades drive a generator, which converts the mechanical energy into electricity.

   - Tidal stream systems require careful site selection to identify areas with strong and consistent tidal currents. Additionally, environmental impact assessments are necessary to minimize disruption to marine ecosystems.

**Tidal Barrage Systems:**

   - Tidal barrage systems utilize the potential energy of the changing tides. They involve the construction of a dam or barrage across an estuary or bay.

   - The barrage contains sluice gates or turbines that allow water to flow into and out of the estuary during the tidal cycle.

   - As the tide rises, water accumulates on one side of the barrage, creating a height difference, or head, between the two sides.

   - When the tide begins to ebb, the sluice gates or turbines are opened, allowing the water to flow from the higher side to the lower side.

   - As the water flows through the turbines, it drives generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated during each tidal cycle.

   - Tidal barrage systems can generate electricity predictably and reliably, but they require suitable geographical features, such as large tidal ranges and estuaries with high flow rates.

Overall, both tidal stream and tidal barrage systems harness the energy of tides to generate electricity, but they operate on different principles. Tidal stream systems capture kinetic energy from moving water currents, while tidal barrage systems utilize the potential energy of the changing tides. Each approach has its own advantages and challenges, and ongoing research and development aim to optimize tidal energy technologies for widespread deployment as a renewable energy source.
