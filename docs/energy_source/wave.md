# Wave Energy

## History

Wave energy has fascinated inventors for centuries, but its practical use for generating electricity is relatively recent. Below is a summary of key milestones in its evolution.

**Early Concepts and Experiments**

- The idea of harnessing wave energy emerged in the 18th century, when engineers began imagining ways to capture the immense power of the sea.
- During the 19th century, several small-scale experiments and prototypes were built to use wave motion for tasks such as pumping water and driving mechanical systems.

**First Patents and Designs**

- The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in patents for wave energy devices. Concepts included oscillating water columns, floating mechanisms, and shoreline-based systems.
- One of the earliest patents, granted in **1799** to French engineer **Girard**, described a *wave-powered water pump* — a pioneering step toward modern wave energy conversion.

**Modern Development**

- The modern phase of wave energy research began in the mid-20th century with growing global interest in renewable energy.
- In the **1970s and 1980s**, countries like the **United States**, **United Kingdom**, **Japan**, and **Norway** launched extensive R&D programs to assess the feasibility of wave-powered electricity.
- Several experimental devices were deployed in open water during this time, producing valuable data that informed future designs.

**Advances in Technology**

- The late 20th and early 21st centuries brought significant technological improvements, including more efficient energy converters and a deeper understanding of ocean wave behavior.
- Various converter types emerged — **oscillating water columns**, **point absorbers**, **attenuators**, and **oscillating wave surge converters** — each using different mechanisms to extract energy from waves.

**Commercial Projects and Pilots**

- Despite notable progress, large-scale commercialization has been slowed by technical, economic, and regulatory challenges.
- However, numerous **pilot projects and small-scale farms** have proven the concept’s viability and potential as a renewable source.
- Countries such as **Scotland**, **Portugal**, **Australia**, and the **United States** continue to lead in testing and deploying wave energy systems in real-world marine environments.

## How It Works

Wave energy is produced by converting the kinetic and potential energy of ocean waves into electricity. Various technologies achieve this through different mechanical principles.

**Wave Energy Capture**

- **Wave Energy Converters (WECs)** are specialized devices that capture the motion of waves. They can be placed near the shore or offshore depending on the design.
- Common types include **oscillating water columns**, **point absorbers**, **attenuators**, and **oscillating wave surge converters**.

**Oscillating Water Columns (OWCs)**

- OWCs consist of a partially submerged chamber with an air cavity above the water.
- As waves move in and out, the water column inside rises and falls, compressing and decompressing the air.
- The changing air pressure drives a **turbine**, which powers a **generator** to produce electricity.

**Point Absorbers**

- Point absorbers are **floating buoys** anchored to the seabed that move up and down with wave motion.
- This vertical motion drives a **mechanical or hydraulic system**, which turns a generator either on the buoy or onshore via an underwater cable.

**Attenuators**

- Attenuators are **long, flexible floating structures** aligned with the direction of incoming waves.
- As waves pass along them, the device bends at its joints. This motion is converted into hydraulic or mechanical energy, which then powers a generator.

**Oscillating Wave Surge Converters (OWSCs)**

- OWSCs capture the **horizontal** motion of waves. These semi-submerged panels or flaps move back and forth as waves pass.
- The motion drives **hydraulic pistons or mechanical linkages**, which in turn generate electricity.

**Electricity Transmission**

- The electricity produced by WECs is transmitted to shore through **underwater cables** or, in some designs, stored temporarily in **onboard battery systems**.
- Once onshore, it is fed into the **electrical grid** or used locally to power coastal facilities and communities.
