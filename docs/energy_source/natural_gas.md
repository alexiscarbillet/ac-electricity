# Natural gas

## History

The use of natural gas for electricity generation has a rich historical background. Here are some key historical facts about the development of natural gas for electricity production:

**Early Uses:** Natural gas has been utilized for lighting and heating since ancient times. In ancient Persia (now Iran), natural gas seeps were used to fuel eternal flames in temples. Similarly, in ancient China, natural gas was used for lighting and heating.

**Gas Lighting:** In the early 19th century, natural gas was used for gas lighting in cities. This involved burning natural gas to produce light in street lamps and buildings. While this was an early use of natural gas, it was not directly tied to electricity generation.

**Introduction to Electricity Generation:** The transition to using natural gas for electricity generation began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Initially, gas-fired power plants were developed to produce electricity for local areas, particularly in urban centers where natural gas infrastructure was available.

**Growth in the 20th Century:** Throughout the 20th century, the use of natural gas for electricity generation expanded significantly. This growth was driven by several factors, including the development of more efficient gas turbine technology, the expansion of natural gas pipeline networks, and environmental concerns surrounding other fossil fuels like coal and oil.

**Combined Cycle Power Plants:** In the latter half of the 20th century, combined cycle power plants emerged as a prominent technology for natural gas-fired electricity generation. These plants use both gas turbines and steam turbines to maximize efficiency by utilizing waste heat from the gas turbine to produce additional electricity.

**Environmental Considerations:** The use of natural gas for electricity generation gained further momentum in the late 20th and early 21st centuries due to its lower emissions compared to coal and oil. Natural gas produces fewer greenhouse gases and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, making it a more environmentally friendly option for electricity generation.

**Modern Applications:** Today, natural gas plays a significant role in global electricity generation, with gas-fired power plants supplying a substantial portion of electricity in many countries. The continued development of natural gas technology, including advances in combined cycle and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants, ensures its continued relevance in the energy landscape.

Overall, the history of natural gas for electricity generation reflects the evolution of energy technology and the ongoing efforts to balance energy needs with environmental concerns.

## How it works

Let's dive into how natural gas is used to generate electricity in modern gas-fired power plants:

**Fuel Combustion:**

   - The process begins with the combustion of natural gas in a combustion chamber within the power plant. Natural gas, composed primarily of methane, is mixed with air and burned in the combustion chamber.

   - The combustion of natural gas releases heat energy. This heat energy raises the temperature of the gases in the combustion chamber.

**Gas Turbine:**

   - The hot gases produced from the combustion process are directed to spin a series of turbine blades mounted on a shaft. This is known as a gas turbine.

   - As the gases expand through the turbine blades, they transfer some of their energy to the turbine, causing it to spin rapidly.

**Electricity Generation - Gas Turbine Stage:**

   - The spinning turbine is connected to an electrical generator, typically through a shaft. As the turbine rotates, it drives the generator, which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

   - This generates electricity, which can be supplied to the electrical grid for distribution to consumers.

**Waste Heat Recovery - Combined Cycle:**

   - In a combined cycle power plant, the hot exhaust gases from the gas turbine are not simply released into the atmosphere. Instead, they are directed to a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).

   - The HRSG is essentially a large boiler that extracts heat from the exhaust gases to produce steam. This steam can reach temperatures and pressures suitable for powering a steam turbine.

**Steam Turbine:**

   - The steam produced by the HRSG is directed to a steam turbine. This turbine operates similarly to the gas turbine but is driven by the force of the steam rather than combustion gases.

   - As the steam expands through the turbine blades, it causes the turbine to rotate, which is connected to another electrical generator.

**Electricity Generation - Steam Turbine Stage:**

   - The rotation of the steam turbine drives the connected generator, producing additional electricity.
   - The combination of the electricity generated by both the gas turbine and the steam turbine results in higher overall efficiency compared to a standalone gas turbine plant.

**Cooling and Emissions Control:**

   - Throughout the process, various systems are in place to cool equipment and control emissions. This may include water cooling systems for the turbines, as well as equipment to remove pollutants from the exhaust gases, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx).

**Grid Connection:**

   - The electricity generated by the gas-fired power plant is then fed into the electrical grid, where it is transmitted and distributed to consumers for use in homes, businesses, and industries.

Overall, gas-fired power plants offer a relatively efficient and reliable method of generating electricity using natural gas as a fuel source, with combined cycle plants providing even higher efficiency by utilizing waste heat for additional electricity generation.
