# Geothermal

## History

Geothermal energy—derived from the Earth's internal heat—has been used for thousands of years for heating, and for over a century to generate electricity. Below is an overview of its evolution.

### Early Use for Heating

Ancient civilizations such as the **Romans**, **Greeks**, and **Chinese** utilized **hot springs** for bathing and space heating, recognizing the natural warmth of the Earth long before the science behind it was understood.

### The First Geothermal Power Generation

In **1904**, Italian engineer **Piero Ginori Conti** built the first **geothermal power plant** in **Larderello, Italy**. Using steam from natural hot springs, the plant powered a small generator—marking the world’s first instance of electricity production from geothermal energy.

### Expansion in Italy

Following Conti’s success, the Italian government expanded geothermal development in **Larderello**. By **1913**, the first **grid-connected geothermal power plant** was operational, supplying electricity on a commercial scale and establishing Italy as a pioneer in geothermal technology.

### Early U.S. Developments

The United States entered the field in the early 20th century. In **1922**, **Boise, Idaho** launched the first **geothermal district heating system** in North America. However, significant progress in geothermal **electricity generation** would not occur until the 1960s and 1970s, driven by advancements in drilling and reservoir engineering.

### Experimental Projects and Growth

During the **1960s–1970s**, several **experimental geothermal plants** were built in the U.S., improving efficiency, refining drilling techniques, and proving large-scale feasibility.  
In **1960**, the first **commercial geothermal power plant** in the U.S.—**The Geysers** in California—was commissioned. It remains one of the world’s largest geothermal complexes today.

### Global Expansion

In the latter half of the 20th century, geothermal development expanded worldwide. Countries with high geothermal potential—such as **Iceland**, **New Zealand**, **the Philippines**, **Kenya**, and **Indonesia**—began investing heavily in geothermal power generation.

### Technological Advances

Modern innovations such as **Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)**, **binary cycle plants**, and **advanced drilling** techniques have made geothermal energy more efficient and accessible, extending its reach beyond volcanic and tectonically active regions.  

Today, geothermal energy is recognized as a **reliable**, **low-emission**, and **renewable** energy source that complements other renewables like wind and solar.

## How It Works

Geothermal power plants convert the **Earth’s internal heat** into **electricity** using naturally heated water and steam trapped beneath the surface.

### 1. Heat Source

The Earth's heat originates from **radioactive decay** and **residual heat** left over from its formation. This energy slowly moves toward the surface, heating underground **rock formations** and **aquifers**.

### 2. Geothermal Reservoirs

**Geothermal reservoirs** are underground zones containing **hot water and steam** within porous or fractured rocks. These are typically found near **volcanic regions**, **tectonic boundaries**, or **geothermal hotspots** where heat from the mantle is closer to the surface.

### 3. Drilling

Wells are drilled several **thousand feet deep** to access geothermal fluids. Specialized drilling techniques ensure efficient extraction while minimizing environmental and geological risks.

### 4. Fluid Extraction

Hot water or steam is brought to the surface through **production wells**.  
- In some cases, **natural pressure** is sufficient to lift the fluid.  
- In others, **pumps** assist in the extraction process.

### 5. Energy Conversion

The extracted heat is used to drive turbines through one of three primary power plant designs:

- **Dry Steam Plants:** Use steam directly from the reservoir to spin a turbine.  
- **Flash Steam Plants:** Extract high-pressure hot water that "flashes" into steam as pressure decreases. The steam then drives the turbine.  
- **Binary Cycle Plants:** Transfer heat from moderately hot geothermal water to a **secondary working fluid** (e.g., isobutane or isopentane) with a lower boiling point. The vaporized secondary fluid drives the turbine, allowing energy generation from lower-temperature resources.

### 6. Electricity Generation

The **turbine** converts the thermal energy of the steam (or secondary vapor) into **mechanical energy**, which drives a **generator**.  
Through **electromagnetic induction**, this motion produces **electricity**, which is then fed into the **power grid** for distribution.

### 7. Injection and Recycling

After energy extraction, the cooled geothermal fluid is **re-injected** into the underground reservoir through **injection wells**.  
This maintains reservoir **pressure** and ensures **sustainability** by replenishing the resource, allowing continuous operation with minimal environmental depletion.

## Summary

Geothermal energy harnesses the **Earth’s natural heat** to produce electricity and heat buildings sustainably. It provides a **stable, renewable**, and **low-carbon** energy source that can operate continuously—unlike intermittent renewables such as solar and wind.  
As drilling and heat-exchange technologies advance, geothermal energy continues to grow as a crucial pillar in the transition toward a **cleaner, more resilient global energy system**.
