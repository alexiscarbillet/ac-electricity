# Coal

## History

Coal has been a cornerstone of electricity generation for more than a century. Its role in powering industrial growth and shaping modern energy systems is significant, though not without environmental costs.

### Early Experiments

The use of coal in electricity generation began in the **19th century**. In the 1820s, **Michael Faraday**’s experiments on **electromagnetic induction** laid the groundwork for electric generators, paving the way for coal-powered electricity production.

### First Coal-Fired Power Station

In **1882**, **Thomas Edison** built the world’s first commercial **coal-fired power station**, the **Pearl Street Station** in New York City.  
The plant burned coal to power steam engines that drove electric generators, supplying electricity to roughly **400 lamps** and a few appliances—marking the dawn of public electricity supply.

### Industrial Expansion

Following Edison’s success, **coal power plants spread rapidly** across industrialized nations. Advances in **steam engine and boiler technology** allowed for larger, more efficient plants capable of meeting rising urban and industrial energy demands.

### Centralized Power Generation

Coal-fired plants played a key role in establishing **centralized electricity systems**, where power was generated in large facilities and transmitted via power lines over long distances. This model became the foundation of modern electrical grids.

### The Shift to Alternating Current (AC)

Edison’s early plants used **direct current (DC)**, which was inefficient for long-distance transmission. The emergence of **alternating current (AC)** systems—pioneered by **Nikola Tesla** and **George Westinghouse**—transformed coal-fired generation, enabling efficient long-range distribution and global AC grid adoption.

### Coal and the Industrial Revolution

The **Industrial Revolution** fueled explosive growth in coal use. Factories, cities, and transportation systems all relied heavily on coal-fired energy, making it the backbone of industrial progress throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

### Environmental and Health Impacts

While coal provided **abundant and affordable energy**, it also introduced serious **environmental and health challenges**. Emissions of **sulfur dioxide (SO₂)**, **nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)**, **particulate matter**, and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** have been linked to **air pollution, acid rain, and climate change**. These issues have driven the modern shift toward cleaner and renewable energy sources.

## How It Works

Coal-fired power plants generate electricity by converting the **chemical energy** stored in coal into **thermal**, then **mechanical**, and finally **electrical energy** through a series of thermodynamic steps.

### 1. Coal Combustion

- Pulverized coal is blown into a **furnace** and burned at extremely high temperatures.  
- The resulting **heat energy** converts water into **steam** inside a **boiler** lined with heat-absorbing tubes.

### 2. Steam Generation

- Water circulating through boiler tubes absorbs heat from combustion gases.  
- The **high-pressure steam** produced is collected and directed toward a **steam turbine**.

### 3. Steam Turbine Operation

- The turbine consists of blades mounted on a rotating shaft.  
- As steam flows across these blades, it spins the turbine, converting **thermal energy** into **mechanical energy**.  
- The turbine drives a **generator**, producing **electricity through electromagnetic induction**.

### 4. Electricity Transmission

- The **alternating current (AC)** produced by the generator is sent to a **transformer**, which increases the voltage for long-distance transmission.  
- Electricity then travels through the **power grid** to homes, industries, and other consumers.

### 5. Steam Condensation and Cooling

- After powering the turbine, the steam exits at lower pressure into a **condenser**.  
- There, it transfers heat to a **cooling medium** (usually water from a river or cooling tower) and condenses back into liquid water.  
- The **condensate** is pumped back to the boiler to repeat the cycle—an example of a **closed-loop system**.

### 6. Emission Control

Modern coal plants use advanced **pollution control technologies** to reduce environmental impact:
- **Scrubbers** remove sulfur dioxide (SO₂).  
- **Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)** systems cut nitrogen oxides (NOₓ).  
- **Electrostatic precipitators** and **fabric filters** capture ash and fine particulates.

### 7. Waste Management

- **Coal ash**, the solid residue from combustion, contains trace metals and other pollutants.  
- It must be carefully **managed or recycled**, often stored in lined landfills or reused in **construction materials** such as cement or concrete.

## Summary

Coal-fired power plants operate by **burning coal to produce steam**, which drives turbines that generate electricity. Despite providing **reliable and large-scale power**, coal remains one of the **most carbon-intensive** energy sources.  
Today, the global energy transition aims to replace coal with **renewable and low-carbon alternatives**, balancing energy reliability with environmental sustainability.
