# Welcome to AC-Electricity

## About the website

This website will contains different topics about electricity and the science behind it.

So far, there are several categories:

- **capacitors**: about the different capacitors and how they are used.

- **conductors**: about the different conductors of electricity.

- **diodes**: explains the different diodes used in the industry.

- **electronic**: explains the science behind electronic.

- **energy source**: about how electricity is produced.

- **hardware**: explains how the different pieces of a computer work.

- **home appliances**: explains how the different devices we use everyday transform electricity into different actions.

- **inductors**: explains the different kind of electrical inductors (dielectrics) and why they are used.

- **insulators**: explains which materials are used as electrical insulators (dielectrics) and why.

- **physical signals**: explains the science behind electricity.

- **resistors**: explains the different kind of electrical resistors and their use.

- **semi-conductors**: about their proprieties and how they are used.

You can find some explanations about [how electricity was discovered and then used through time](history.md).

## About the author

Hello, I am Alexis Carbillet and this is my third website. I thought it would be fun to talk about electricity while using mkdocs, so here we are.

I coded from scratch my other three websites.

- The First one is [ac-programming.com](https://ac-programming.com/), which is related to different fields of IT and contains most of my personnal projects in this field.

- The second one is [all-about-cats.uk](https://all-about-cats.uk/), which is about cats and their features.

- The last one is [ac-serverhub.com](https://ac-serverhub.com/). It allows you to explore the latest and most powerful hardware components for servers.
