# Paper Capacitors

## History

Paper capacitors were among the earliest capacitor types used in electrical circuits. Their development was driven by the need for reliable, high-voltage capacitors in the early 20th century:

* **Origins**: Invented in the early 1900s, these capacitors became common in radios, power supplies, and other electronics by the 1920s and 1930s.

* **Construction**: Made by layering two metal foils separated by waxed or oil-soaked paper, then rolling them into cylindrical or flat shapes. The assembly was sealed in wax, resin, or metal casing.

* **Evolution**: Improvements over time included better impregnation materials to prevent moisture ingress and breakdown, leading to longer life spans and better performance.

* **Obsolescence**: By the 1960s and 1970s, paper capacitors were largely replaced by more stable and compact film and ceramic capacitors.

* **Legacy**: Still found in vintage equipment and are sometimes reproduced for restoration and audio enthusiasts due to their unique tonal characteristics.

## How It Works

Paper capacitors operate based on the principle of storing energy in an electric field between conductive plates separated by an insulating dielectric—in this case, treated paper.

### Key Properties:

1. **Dielectric Material**: Paper serves as the dielectric, usually impregnated with oil, wax, or plastic to improve insulating properties and reduce moisture absorption.

2. **Capacitance Range**: Typically range from a few nanofarads (nF) to several microfarads (μF), with voltage ratings up to several hundred volts.

3. **Moisture Sensitivity**: Prone to degradation over time due to moisture, which can lead to increased leakage current and eventual failure.

4. **Temperature Performance**: Moderate stability, but less reliable under high heat compared to modern materials.

5. **Encapsulation**: Sealed in wax, resin, or metal containers to slow degradation and prevent moisture ingress.

6. **Applications**:

   * Power supply filtering (early radios and TVs)
   * Coupling and decoupling in audio circuits
   * Signal bypassing
   * Motor start and run circuits (in early designs)

Paper capacitors are largely obsolete today but remain a niche choice for specific legacy applications and audio restoration projects where period accuracy or sonic character is desired.
