## History

The use of film as a dielectric material in capacitors represents a significant advancement in capacitor technology. Here are some historical facts about the use of film in capacitors:

**Emergence of Film Capacitors**: Film capacitors began to gain prominence in the mid-20th century as an alternative to traditional paper and mica capacitors. The development of polymer films, such as polyester (Mylar), polypropylene, polycarbonate, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), provided new opportunities for capacitor design and construction.

**Advantages of Film Dielectrics**: Film materials offered several advantages over paper and mica dielectrics, including higher dielectric strength, lower dielectric loss, better temperature stability, and improved reliability. These properties made film capacitors suitable for a wide range of electronic applications, from consumer electronics to industrial and aerospace systems.

**Polyester Film Capacitors (Mylar)**: Polyester film capacitors, often referred to as Mylar capacitors, were among the earliest types of film capacitors developed. Mylar is a type of polyester film known for its high tensile strength, excellent dielectric properties, and chemical resistance. Mylar capacitors became popular due to their affordability, reliability, and versatility.

**Polypropylene Film Capacitors**: Polypropylene film capacitors emerged as a popular choice for applications requiring high stability, low dielectric loss, and excellent electrical performance. Polypropylene films offer superior temperature stability and low dissipation factor compared to polyester films, making them suitable for precision applications such as audio equipment and signal processing circuits.

**Polycarbonate Film Capacitors**: Polycarbonate film capacitors were developed for applications requiring high dielectric strength, high-frequency stability, and low dielectric absorption. Polycarbonate films offer excellent electrical properties and temperature stability, making them suitable for use in telecommunications, aerospace, and automotive electronics.

**Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Film Capacitors**: PET film capacitors, also known as polyester capacitors, are widely used in consumer electronics, lighting systems, and power electronics. PET films offer good dielectric strength, low dielectric loss, and high moisture resistance, making them suitable for a variety of applications.

**Metallized Film Capacitors**: In metallized film capacitors, a thin metal layer is deposited onto the surface of the film dielectric to form the capacitor electrodes. Metallized film capacitors offer advantages such as self-healing properties, reduced size, and improved performance compared to conventional foil-type capacitors.

**Applications**: Film capacitors find use in various electronic and electrical applications, including power supplies, motor drives, inverters, lighting systems, audio equipment, telecommunications, aerospace, and automotive electronics. They are valued for their stability, reliability, long lifespan, and high performance in demanding environments.

## How it works

Film capacitors are widely regarded as excellent capacitor types due to their superior electrical properties, reliability, and versatility. Here's an explanation of why film is a great capacitor material and how it works in detail:

1. **Dielectric Properties**: Film materials used in capacitors, such as polyester (Mylar), polypropylene, polycarbonate, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), exhibit excellent dielectric properties. These materials have high dielectric strength, meaning they can withstand high electric fields without breaking down. Additionally, they have low dielectric losses, which minimizes energy dissipation and ensures efficient capacitor operation.

2. **Temperature Stability**: Film capacitors offer excellent temperature stability over a wide range of operating temperatures. This stability ensures that the capacitance and other electrical properties remain relatively constant even in varying thermal conditions. It makes film capacitors suitable for use in environments with temperature fluctuations or where precise capacitance values are required.

3. **High Insulation Resistance**: Film materials have high insulation resistance, meaning they provide excellent electrical insulation between the capacitor's electrodes. This property prevents leakage currents and ensures the capacitor maintains its charge over time, contributing to its long-term stability and reliability.

4. **Low Dielectric Absorption**: Film capacitors typically exhibit low dielectric absorption, also known as the soakage effect. Dielectric absorption refers to the phenomenon where the dielectric material retains some charge after the applied voltage is removed. Low dielectric absorption in film capacitors ensures fast discharge times and accurate capacitance values, particularly in timing circuits and precision applications.

5. **Self-Healing Properties**: Metallized film capacitors, where a thin metal layer is deposited onto the surface of the film dielectric, exhibit self-healing properties. If a localized breakdown occurs in the dielectric due to a voltage spike or overvoltage condition, the metal layer vaporizes, creating a small gap that prevents further breakdown. This self-healing mechanism enhances the reliability and lifespan of film capacitors.

6. **High Breakdown Voltage**: Film capacitors can be designed to withstand high breakdown voltages, making them suitable for use in high-voltage applications. This property allows film capacitors to safely operate in circuits with elevated voltage levels, such as power supplies, motor drives, and electric vehicles.

7. **Chemical Resistance**: Film materials used in capacitors are often chemically resistant to moisture, solvents, and environmental contaminants. This resistance protects the capacitor from degradation and ensures consistent performance even in harsh operating conditions.

8. **Construction**: Film capacitors are typically constructed by winding or stacking alternating layers of film dielectric and metal foil electrodes. The wound or stacked configuration allows for the formation of compact, high-capacitance capacitors with excellent electrical properties. The capacitor structure may be encapsulated or impregnated with insulating materials to protect the components from moisture and contaminants.
